Email geeks, welcome back to another episode of Feedback Friday. We've been away for a minute, but this week, we are joined by a fantastic guest: Megan from Mailgun. She's not only the senior developer at Mailgun, but she also hosts Email on Acid's <em>""Notes from the Dev""</em>&nbsp;and her own podcast, and is the writer of&nbsp;<em>""It Depends</em>,"" an email newsletter that I subscribe to, which focuses on email marketing.</p><p>This week, we're diving into some Email Camp messages that I'm really excited to examine. If you want to learn more about segmentation, personalization, clear calls to action, and including informational content in a fun and compelling way, this is the one for you. Let's dive right in. You're joining this week to look at some Email Camp emails, which are a highlight of my year every year. Could you do an introduction? You've got a lot going on. You’ve got a podcast, you’ve got a newsletter—plug some stuff.</p><p><strong>Megan Boshuyzen</strong>: I do all the things. Oh my gosh. Okay. So I handle all of the lifecycle marketing emails for Mailgun, Mailjet, Email on Acid. I do all the emails for Email Camp. I also have my newsletter, <em>It Depends</em>, which I send out about once a month about email marketing, development, and other random things. And I have a slightly email-related, but mostly not email-related podcast with my email bestie, Karen Slater, called <em>Geek Out with Megan and Karen</em>. And it's just how it sounds: we geek out about anime, cartoons, movies, books, all sorts of things. That’s all the things I do professionally.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Also, <em>Notes from the Dev</em>, right?</p><p><strong>Megan Boshuyzen</strong>: That's been on a little bit of a hiatus, which is why I forgot to mention it. Yeah. There have been numerous interviews in past episodes that are pretty awesome, offering some amazing tips and tricks on how to do cool things in email.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Awesome. Great. Well, the first email we received from Email Camp was actually from last year, 2023, and the theme this year was Mission Control—got that space theme. Would you like to review some of the key points in this email and discuss what you liked about it?</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/96fcb756d7c6406fb4921b67d51b0fb4"">(<a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/incoming-message-from-email-camp-mission-control"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">See the full email</a>)</p><p><strong>Megan Boshuyzen</strong>: Yeah, so the Mission Control space theme was really fun. Our big announcement email—if you got it in your inbox, you probably saw the big <em>Star Wars</em> reproduction intro, which is one of my prides and joys of coding, which was very fun.</p><p>However, going through this, we just have our simple introduction. This shows the information about the general conference. Our conference is completely free and virtual—we say that repeatedly. Will it be recorded? Yes, it will be recorded. It is always recorded. We say it's recorded so many times, and people still ask if it's going to be recorded. This is the first touchstone to inform people that it's coming up, to get it started, and to register.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Nice. Yeah, I definitely like this one. It stood out to me. I love the use of live text on these buttons, these different sections. Is there anything you would like to change?</p><p><strong>Megan Boshuyzen</strong>: Yeah, I think the one thing that's always a struggle when doing live text over images is making sure everything's readable. Like, if we look at the “One Giant Leap for Email Geeks,” that “G,” the contrast over that rock is not very good. Sometimes, when you're aiming for a visually striking design, you need to make concessions, especially with a responsive email. We can see that in the mobile view, you can read it much better than in the desktop view. That’s something I always remain really conscious of and try to avoid—poor contrast situations.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Yeah, I love this one. I think it's pretty straightforward. I did have a couple of notes. I always love to see some hover effects on CTAs whenever possible—even some opacity—just to give a heads up that something’s clickable. I know it's only a desktop feature, but that's always a plus for me. One other thing I noticed across other event and webinar emails is that they include people's faces, the topics they're discussing, or company logos. I'd be curious to test this to see if you get higher signups by including more details of who’s going to be speaking.</p><p><strong>Megan Boshuyzen</strong>: Yeah, if you look at the whole series of emails, when we send them out, we start really broad, and then as we get closer to the event, we add more details. Like right now, I’m working on the third email of the series for this year’s Email Camp, and that’s when we start getting into what the keynotes are. Or if you look at our 2022 Email Camp emails, we had one that was literally just a grid of all of our different speakers, with names and titles.</p><p>This one, being the first, and often, we’re still finalizing details when it goes out, is definitely more high-level. Then, we become increasingly detailed as the discussion progresses.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Very nice. Another trend we’re no longer seeing as much is the countdown GIF that counts down to the event. Do you see that going away, or is it something you might still use?</p><p><strong>Megan Boshuyzen</strong>: Yeah. We've never really used a countdown GIF, mostly because that involves third parties, and our budget hasn’t really allowed us to incorporate things like that. One thing I would love to incorporate is personalized images, but I haven’t had the budget to invest in something like Nifty Images or Movable Ink to make that happen. Maybe one day. My one question about countdown timers that I haven't received a clear answer to is: How accurate can they be anymore with all the prefetching and MPP going on, where we can’t really determine when an email is accurately opened?</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: I agree. It's kind of a gray area. I feel like many brands have moved away from it because they’re unsure if it'll be supported. If there’s another way to create urgency that doesn’t involve a countdown timer, definitely try that. But I’m starting to see fewer of them—like you said, because they involve third parties, they add cost, and if you’re getting the same results without them, why bother?</p><p><strong>Megan Boshuyzen</strong>: We usually send an email out a week beforehand and then again the day before. And I can say with certainty that the day-before email is one of our highest-converting ones, because we say, “It’s happening tomorrow.” Since it’s a free, virtual event, there are no logistics for someone to figure out far in advance. So, if they receive that last email the day before, they think, “Okay, I’ll register,” and they can do it right then and there. That email usually does really well.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: I agree—the “last chance” one definitely converts.</p><p><strong>Megan Boshuyzen</strong>: Yeah, so we definitely use the “Last Chance” send.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Befree is the best way to go from inspiration to creation.

It looks like, hey, this is “I just registered,” and it says, you know, “Hi [First Name], thanks for registering.” There are some little teaser links here. Yeah, I really like this one. And again, you always say it’s going to be recorded. It's quite short, sweet, and to the point. Yep. Did you have any other thoughts on this one? What do you think worked well?</p><p><strong>Megan Boshuyzen</strong>: I love the simplicity of this one. This year's one is even shorter, and I ended up adding a header image to it because it fit the theme so well, and the logo looked very empty without an image. So I made that change this year. But other than that, I don’t think I’d make any changes to the confirmation email. The one thing I wanted to do with this confirmation email, as I mentioned earlier, was to provide a personalized digital badge for the person who registered. Hopefully, one day I’ll be able to do that. I wanted it as an opportunity for somebody to take that image and share it on social media for further promotion and get some social sharing going. But again, budget and whatnot—we haven’t been able to pull that off yet. Perhaps you could do it in live text, in a layout, or something similar, but again, that means relying on a third-party service. It could be tricky.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Yeah. I’ve thought about doing it via live text, but it was the data needed and how the different systems were working. We were setting up new event software, and it just wasn’t ready in time. That’s definitely something I thought about, but it was just timing and the amount of work for everything else. It was one of the things we had to let go.</p><p><strong>Megan Boshuyzen</strong>: The only other note I had, which I’ve seen other people do as well, is that in previous Email Camps, you’ve always had a host. I thought it would be kind of cool to maybe incorporate that person into the confirmation email. Something in letter format, like “Looking forward to seeing you, I’m excited.” That could create some extra connection. I was curious too—before we move on, do you do any remarketing to these people after you send out the recordings? Is there a follow-up email, or do you simply keep them in the database and then send the VIP email for the next event?</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: We have done some email nurturing after the event, sending them information. Many of the sessions are also turned into articles on our websites, where we summarize the key points in a blog post and link to the recording, as they are all hosted on YouTube. We do a lot with the content so that people can access it in various ways.</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/b3467fd611834523a96ba9aee6bb2702"">(<a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/this-is-email-camp-messagemania"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">See the full email</a>)</p><p>Alright, now we’re here for the main event—Email Camp, Message Mania, the exciting conference that’s coming. I’m obsessed with this theme, and I definitely want to plug our Really Good Emails. Mike Nelson will be giving a talk about design trends, so I’m excited to attend that. However, I’m even more excited about this event. The lineup is stacked. Definitely go visit this one.</p><p><strong>Megan Boshuyzen</strong>: Oh my gosh. I’m just so in love with these graphics. They were done by our designer, Kim Kirby. Every year she works on Email Camp, and every year she hits it out of the park. I don’t know how she’s going to outdo herself the next year, and then somehow it’s even better. It’s amazing. There’s nothing here I would change. I love this email design, and it takes a lot for me to say that I love something I’ve created. For this particular email, I think it’s well-structured, easy to read and scan, and we have several CTAs. Hopefully, a lot of people will click on it and register.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Nice. Yes, I meant to mention that in the other email as well. I really like the CTA copy. It’s not just an RSVP—you’re trying some different copy text here that I really like. And again, everything’s live text, really accessible, and it looks great on both desktop and mobile. So yeah, I really appreciate that.</p><p><strong>Megan Boshuyzen</strong>: Yeah. If you look at the header image, you'll see the phrase “Are you ready?” which is a reference to a wrestling catchphrase. That first CTA, when I added it, wasn’t originally part of the design. I thought the email was too long to have only the CTA at the bottom, so I added a second one. I originally put in “Woo” because that’s a wrestling thing. Then Julia, a brilliant copywriter, suggested changing it to “I’m ready,” so it would respond to the header. That was brilliant because it provides consistency throughout the entire email. Designers and copywriters often overlook the experience throughout the entire email. Sometimes it gets disconnected. But here it all flows nicely.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: I’m a big fan of this one. I also had some other notes. I think I messaged you about maybe adding some animation. Personally, I prefer a subtle element in the header to catch the attention. I was thinking “Are you ready?” could load in each word separately. To me, subtle animation works, and sometimes you don’t have to worry as much about fallbacks depending on the client or browser. I also love hearing about how you incorporated data from the previous event. It feels a little more personalized, not generic. Styling some of the text with bolding creates hierarchy. And my last question—an interesting design choice compared to the previous one—is the placement of the button. In this one, the button is locked into a block instead of being separate. I think it works, but I expected it to be lower down.</p><p><strong>Megan Boshuyzen</strong>:&nbsp;It was originally on its own, and I didn’t like how it felt like it was floating underneath compared to the other cards. I experimented with adding an image and the structure, which I think works better visually. Sometimes there’s too much white space. As a former designer, I could feel it wasn’t right, and if it doesn’t feel right to me, it won’t feel right to others. I prefer having the main text on a purple background as the primary message, then breaking it down into separate days, and finally including a secondary CTA.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Nice. I also appreciate that this is left-aligned. Some people might be tempted to center the text, but for readability, I definitely prefer it this way.</p><p><strong>Megan Boshuyzen</strong>: Yes. Email accessibility and live text are two of the things I prioritize most. You’ll see me using live text almost always, 99.9% of the time. Having “Are you ready?” in the image is less common for me, but it fits the image and the theme, so I was fine with it. I wrote very descriptive alt text for the image to cover accessibility. You have to know when to push and when to pull.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Exactly. How is this email different from the previous one?</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/b99b982e32174d46b953de7db073f78c"">(<a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/email-camp-is-back-and-its-messagemania"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">See the full email</a>)</p><p><strong>Megan Boshuyzen</strong>: This is our “VIP email.” It goes out only to people who registered for Email Camp the previous year. They get the first email because we know they’re engaged and will click and register. We’ve had really high click-through rates on this one. This goes out first, and then the other email we were looking at is sent a couple of weeks later to our entire audience across all our brands.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: That’s smart. I’m curious—plain text versus designed email for VIPs. I wonder if they would perform the same, like more of an invitation.</p><p><strong>Megan Boshuyzen</strong>: It would be interesting to A/B test something like this against a plain-text email from Thomas Krin, our MC each year, inviting people to register. I hadn’t thought about that, but it could be fun to try next year.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Well, this is a very impressive hover effect. One of the rare times I’ve seen this. What CSS value is this?</p><p><strong>Megan Boshuyzen</strong>: It’s just a basic hover effect. It only has the nice transition on Apple devices. Gmail supports the hover effect, where text gets bigger, but it snaps to a larger size. I thought it was fun—like “Let’s get ready to rumble” right before a match starts.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Well, you’ll see me at this event. I’ll be in a full luchador mask or something like that.</p><p><strong>Megan Boshuyzen</strong>: Yes. Love it.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Thanks so much for walking through these emails today. I really appreciate it.</p><p><strong>Megan Boshuyzen</strong>: Yeah, I’m excited for this event. My pleasure. I would just say register. We’ve expanded it to a third day to include omnichannel, which will be really fun and interesting since Cinch, our company, is a leader in SMS messaging, RCS, and similar technologies. I believe we will have sessions on how to combine all of this. Definitely keep an eye out. It’s going to be really fun. Email Camp is a great time.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Thanks so much. Have a great rest of your week.</p>",mtthlbg,mtthlbg,,,"Mon, 29 Sep 2025 22:00:00 GMT"

Welcome back to another episode of Feedback Friday. This week, we're diving into the Going.com rebrand with Lori Dennis. We'll be reviewing their email strategies and how they communicated this massive change to their email subscribers, from dynamic content and personalization to driving app downloads and consistent branding.</p><p>Going has really nailed it, and as a bonus guest this week, we've got Justine Jordan with her expert insights, helping us break everything down. Stick around as we explore how they combine stellar design with effective content strategies to keep their audience engaged, informed, and excited. Let's jump right in.</p><p>Lori, do you want to introduce yourself?</p><p><strong>Lori Dennis</strong>: Absolutely. Thank you so much for having me. I'm Lori Dennis. I've worked at Going for almost three years now, and I'm the Director of Customer Marketing. I'll first actually give a little background on Going. Going is a tech startup in the travel space. We are a subscription service with more than 2 million members, and our aim is to help our members never overpay for flights again. Going sends flight alerts for your home airport.</p><p>So you sign up, tell us where you like to fly from and where you hope to go if you already have a destination in mind, and we alert you when we find great flight deals. I manage a super-talented team responsible for lifecycle marketing, product marketing, promotional campaigns, email development, and web development.</p><p>We are huge fans of Really Good Emails because, for a long time—in fact, most of the time that we've been in business—our primary product has been email. Those flight deal alerts I was talking about that we send to members’ inboxes were our product for almost eight years. It's changed a little bit recently.</p><p>We launched our first mobile app in March 2024. Now, we're also in the business of push notifications and several other marketing channels, but email is still a very strong core piece of our daily operations at Going. So, I'm very excited to be here talking about our emails.</p><p><strong>Justine Jordan</strong>: I'm here nerding out because we get to talk to Lori.</p><p>I have been a big fan of Going’s emails for, well, since they were Scott’s Cheap Flights. They've enabled me to travel to some really cool destinations, and I've always admired so many of the emails that we're about to talk about today. Primarily, one of the things I've admired is the tie between how well they bring their email strategy to life with really awesome, brilliant design. And so digging into the details of that with Lori is why I am very excited about this conversation.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Yeah, and thank,s Justine. You actually discovered these emails, you submitted them to Really Good Emails, so I appreciate you doing some research. But yeah, for a long time, these have been an inspiration and definitely some heavy hitters on these emails.</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/3b7ea906dea04144a124ba2ec75b6dbf""></p><p>(<a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/big-secret-inside"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">See the full image</a>)</p><p>So, to jump into this first email, it caught our eye just because Scott’s Cheap Flights was a well-known name. However, it transitioned to Going, and we don’t really see a lot of rebrands in emails. So, I think we wanted to focus on this one and just kind of learn if there were some lessons about how you can use email to communicate a rebrand effectively.</p><p><strong>Lori Dennis</strong>: Yeah, sure. This is a great one to start with. The goals for this email were to inform all of our members that we had changed our name and explain why we were doing this, and also to reassure them that our services and their experience would not be changing at all. So we had to do all those things within an email while also hyping up the new brand. It was a tall order, kind of a challenging one to pull off, but I think we did a pretty great job of balancing all those things.</p><p>We knew this rebrand would be really exciting, both internally and for our members, but we also knew that it would be a pretty hard sell for a lot of folks who had been with us for a long time. At the time we sent this email, which was in early 2023, we had been Scott’s Cheap Flights for nearly eight years. We have a lot of members who have been with us for almost that entire time. Travelers who had been getting Scott’s flight deals for four years, five years, and more. We deeply understood that Scott’s Cheap Flights had a certain small insider-secret feel to it, whereas Going feels much bigger. So we were trying to be very mindful of that. One of the goals was really to bring members along with us on the journey and make them feel like a part of it. We also knew that we had to go out with a message that felt exciting and engaging but was also informative and reassuring.</p><p>So all those goals I mentioned at the beginning, we really wanted to make sure our members understood that our mission did not change, that Scott is still here, and that's the section you have up now. You can see all the different callouts: we’re getting better, a mobile app is coming. We were already teasing the app almost a year before it launched. I think it was super successful. I think we accomplished everything we set out to do. Of course, there were people who were upset about the rebrand — nothing we can do about that.</p><p><strong>Justine Jordan</strong>: One of the things I remember, having been a recipient of this email, is how you announced the rebrand and then not only tied the email design but also tied it into the inbox experience. So if I recall, the emails came from Scott’s Cheap Flights, then it was Scott’s Cheap Flights Going, and then Going formally. And if I recall, you even had certain milestones that you were looking for that informed the strategy of how you led people down that transition.</p><p><strong>Lori Dennis</strong>: The progression of the rollout of the brand relaunch was actually really long. It started months before we even came out with this announcement. We didn’t want the announcement to be a complete surprise for members, so that was really part of the aim of bringing them along on the journey with us. We did run a short teaser campaign ahead of the launch. We also conducted member surveys along the way to make sure we were on the right track. This was part of a much larger strategic rollout that did include changing our name in the “from” email address over time, exactly as you said. We were Scott’s Cheap Flights for a long time. We knew that if we suddenly started sending emails from Going, we were going to run into deliverability issues first and foremost, but also really confuse people who maybe missed the announcement email or maybe didn’t subscribe to this type of email from us and didn’t receive it at all.</p><p>So we had to be really mindful and thoughtful about the rollout. We had banners on almost all of our emails for a few months, letting people know, “Going, formerly Scott’s Cheap Flights,” in addition to the teaser campaign. We had a couple of versions of this email. We had a dedicated landing page for information. We ran a social campaign. There were PR efforts behind the rebrand. Scott got on Reddit and did an AMA, which was pretty popular. There was a lot happening behind the scenes in support of this campaign. It wasn’t just this one email — truly a multi-channel effort.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Speaking of this email, it’s honestly like a masterclass of design and strategy all working together. Like you said, email is an extension of the product, or your only product at the time. To me, it really shows respect for the audience and shows that you are thinking critically about both the development, design, and strategy. Because there are lots of little subtle pieces in here, lots of best practices: the use of the icons, the “we love Scott” callouts, all these things coming together. Little points that show a lot of attention to this channel specifically. It’s really cool to see.</p><p><strong>Lori Dennis</strong>: If people wanted to know more about the rebrand than we presented in this one email, we did have a couple of places where we linked to more of a deep dive into why we did it and what we did. The rebrand itself, the new color palette, the new fonts, the new logo — truly a deep dive into the design. So if people wanted more information, it was available for them. And the video at the top, too, was a really good showcase of why we rebranded. I highly encourage folks to watch that — it’s still live, actually, at going.com/rebrand. I think the team did a great job pulling it together, making it fun, and building some excitement.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Yeah, I love the balance. I feel like there’s almost some constraint, too, because you could include a lot more content in this, but I really appreciate bringing in the essentials and trying to trim it down. And then, if people want more information, of course, they can visit these links or the video. This is a really, really good email.</p><p><strong>Justine Jordan</strong>: That’s a great point. It’s hard to dial in that messaging and have that constraint to be like, this is what the audience cares the most about. Versus so many brands hype up their rebrand when everyone is really just wondering, “Well, what’s going to change for me?” And you do a really good job of addressing that.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Yeah, I think it just shows a real understanding of your audience. Alright, well we’ve got another email moving through these. This is a premium travel credit card, a feud. Do you want to explain a little bit about this one?</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/0ab5d585720540cc8491f59c56a34d21""></p><p>(<a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/battle-of-the-premium-travel-cards"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">See the full email</a>)</p><p><strong>Justine Jordan</strong>: The thing that stood out to me when I first saw this in my inbox was just how dense the email was with information, but also how beautifully the design presents a very dense wall of text. And this came out around that kind of infamous conflict that was going on. Lori, if I recall, there’s a really interesting reason why you named these cards after those individuals and how that integrated into this strategy behind the email, and also how your team designed it.</p><p><strong>Lori Dennis: </strong>Yes, absolutely. This is one of our newsletters. We do send out newsletters to our members weekly. Due to our affiliate rules with credit cards, we can’t use the branded names of the cards themselves in emails, so as a workaround, we played off of that ongoing feud in pop culture by calling the cards the names of Kendrick and Drake and pitting them against each other.</p><p>It was very relevant at the time. We had also run a similar format a few months before, calling the cards Beyoncé and Taylor, and that was one of the highest-revenue newsletters we’ve ever sent out. So yes, very dense. Most of our newsletters are very dense, with very helpful, useful information, but it’s always a challenge to figure out how to present that in a way that is clear, easy to read, broken up with those fun branded illustrations along the way, and just calling out the different sections of information using hierarchy of design and different CTAs for different things. Those point to articles on our website where you can actually read the names of the cards. We just can’t do it in the emails. So yeah, this was a fun one.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: You know, incorporating the branding, you know, spacing things out, making it easy to read, including some CTAs, these breakout sections really, like you said, make it easy to consume this content and kind of follow along on this journey and learn about the different products. And then I didn’t know we wanted to call out this top section because it’s something that we don’t really see a lot: this link to the Going app and also these social share newsletter links up here.</p><p><strong>Lori Dennis</strong>: So this newsletter was sent out shortly after the app launched, and the “Download the app” button was our way of getting more people into the app ecosystem. A lot of our members don’t yet have the app downloaded, so we are always prompting that action. If they already have the app, however, we can see that and personalize it by removing that link. So if you already have the app, you’re not going to see that in your emails. The sharing functionality is also relatively new, but it is working super well. The sharing link takes you to a version of this article on the website where you can copy the link and send it out, but you can also share it on Facebook or X, and it just helps tremendously with the distribution of these messages.</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/252ebd00a33d461697853934cd48c365""></p><p>(<a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/what-to-do-if-your-flight-is-changed-or-canceled"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">See the full email</a>)</p><p><strong>Mat Helbig</strong>: Nice. Cool. Alright, well we can jump over to the next one here.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Lori Dennis</strong>: This “In the Know” send — another really text-heavy one.</p><p><strong>Justien Jordan</strong>: It is. And when I was choosing my favorite emails from Going, there were so many that were potentially my favorite. But this one was really interesting to me because, as a marketer, I’ve struggled in the past with balancing sponsored with editorial and our own content strategy goals. And this is again where I was just so curious to hear from Lori: how do you handle this? Not only is it dense information designed really well, but the content strategy combines sponsored and editorial.</p><p><strong>Lori Dennis</strong>: I think this one, when I went back to the team and asked them for things they might improve if we sent it again, they reflected on the fact that it’s maybe too text-heavy, and we might want to break this one up a little bit more, kind of in the way the last one was. It does contain a lot of helpful information and great resources to empower travelers to have their travel go as smoothly as expected, even if plans are disrupted. But we probably could format this one a little better to highlight the resources and make it a little more digestible.</p><p>We did okay with the bolding and the bullet points, but I think we could have done more with this one. The sponsorship is interesting. The Element co-branding on this one feels very editorial. If you go back up to the first ad, we have a few different ad placements in our newsletters, so this would be our primary ad. And if you read the first line there, it says, “Do flight changes and cancellations stress you out when you’re traveling?” That is exactly what this newsletter is about.</p><p>We work closely with our ad sponsors to customize their copy to ensure it feels somewhat editorial. Not every advertiser is game to do that, but Element has been working with us for a while. We worked closely with them to tie their copy in with the topic of the week so it doesn’t necessarily feel like a blatant ad, even though that is what it is.</p><p><strong>Justien Jordan</strong>: That’s what I loved about it — I felt like it was woven together in such a way that it felt more natural and not just pushy. So great job.</p><p><strong>Lori Dennis</strong>: The other thing I was going to say about this newsletter is the timing of it. We send a version of this email almost every year and update it, but we sent it this year, particularly around travel time, when we were expecting that flights would be canceled or changed, or delayed. So think prime summer peak travel season or around the winter holidays, when we tend to see spikes in travel delays and cancellations. It’s especially relevant for members around those times, and we tend to see higher engagement when we really thoughtfully time out our topics.</p><p><strong>Mat Helbig</strong>: Yeah, I definitely love the sponsorship. You see a lot of brands just throw it in like a banner or something, but I think including it as part of the email feels a little bit more editorial, as you said, and kind of brings it together. It still stays true to the brand without feeling too intrusive. So definitely a fan.</p><p>Beefree is the best way to go from inspiration to creation.

We’ve got a very pretty Valencia email here. I like the use of photography here, some GIFs. Do you want to talk about this one a little bit?</p><p><strong>Lori Dennis</strong>: This Valencia email is one of our destination-themed newsletters sent to members each Wednesday, where we take a really deep dive into one specific place or experience. We hypothesized that this one would perform really well in the height of summer — again, that timing thing — which influenced when we decided to run it, playing into the fact that people are dreaming of a European summer vacation. We did see really great engagement with this one. If you scroll to the top, you see in the green band it says, “Add VLC to your watch list.” This is a recent addition to the newsletters, and that watch list feature is for paid members only. Our members on our free tier don’t actually see that same message. They instead see an upsell prompt to upgrade to start their watch list.</p><p>That button — you must have been a paying member when you received this email to see that. If you click on it and you’re logged into our website, it automatically adds Valencia to the list of destinations you’ve told us you want to go to, and we’ll start watching for flight alerts for you. So that’s a pretty cool product email integration that I think is working quite well. It also tells you on the right how many destinations you’re watching.</p><p>Justine Jordan: Yeah. That’s what stood out to me when I first saw this. And again, it made me really wonder about the strategy behind it, because I was a paying member at the time. As you said, email is the primary product, the primary way that I engage with the brand. I don’t log into the website all that often, and so I actually didn’t know about the watch list feature at all until I saw that banner in the email. And I’m assuming that was one of the reasons why you put it in there — to get people to start actually using it and to draw more adoption and awareness.</p><p><strong>Lori Dennis</strong>: Yep. There’s another prompt for it at the bottom too.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Yes. This is such a cool area. This layout is awesome to see in email, and I think it does a really good job of breaking out some information to make it a little bit easier to read. And then, as you said, the “Add to watch list” and “View all deals” CTAs make it all feel really complete.</p><p><strong>Lori Dennis</strong>: We have a great design system in place at Going, and we do need to cram a lot of information into these emails at a glance and make them really easy to scan and just know exactly what you’re getting when you go to Valencia. This table is a really clean way to accomplish that. And these icons — I love our iconography system, it’s great.</p><p>The section below that, the price history section — oh man, it looks simple. It really does, but it’s not at all.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Yeah, this being live text was so impressive to me.</p><p><strong>Lori Dennis</strong>: Yeah. That’s all done with code, so it’s a series of tables nested within tables. That speech bubble triangle at the bottom, the little green and peach-colored pills — that was really tricky to code. We had to use conditional code to create that triangle shape and then hide it for email platforms that don’t support it. It’s a lot more than meets the eye. Also, the rounded corner CSS — the design team designed it a certain way, they asked our email developer if it could be done, and she figured it out using existing examples, Litmus Scope, and also by making a lot of small tweaks to really get it to function just right.</p><p><strong>Justine Jordan</strong>: Let’s give a round of applause to the designer-developer duo that figured that out, because that’s pretty impressive.</p><p>Lori Dennis: Yes. And again, that “Add to watch list” button: if you are not a paying member, if you’re on our free tier, you would see a prompt to start your watch list by upgrading.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Even here on mobile, you can tell that someone took the time to test and stack the CTAs. How this email looks on a desktop is also really reflected on mobile. And I kind of assume that maybe your audience is more mobile-first.</p><p><strong>Lori Dennis</strong>: It’s definitely skewing that direction. For a long time, that was not the case, but we’re seeing almost a 50/50 split at this point, and we are aiming to be a mobile-first company. So we’ll definitely see things continue in that direction.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: The different considerations that you’ve made on each screen size are definitely awesome to see.</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/9beb01a4e16940e2842d9959e237b420""></p><p>(<a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/get-real-money-for-helping-your-friends-travel"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">See the full email</a>)</p><p>This next email here is a referral email. I always like to see these. Not a ton of brands do these, but this one stood out to me just because I think it was done really well. And there are a lot of smart pieces in here, not just a link to share or something like that. It kind of explains the whole program.</p><p><strong>Lori Dennis</strong>: This email was the inaugural announcement of our new referral program. It was our first change to the program since 2021, so people were pretty used to the old one. We completely shifted the structure. You used to be able to refer friends and earn free time with Going, and now it’s about earning money.</p><p>This email served a few purposes. We wanted to announce the new program and hype it up and get people excited about it, but also to educate members on all the various ways that they can refer people to Going. So we kept it pretty short. We wanted to make sure people read it all. The copy is really short, to the point, bulleted, to get out the message that our referral program is unique and that you can refer people not just with a link, but also by sharing deals.</p><p><strong>Justine Jordan</strong>: It’s also just so concrete, like you said, going from earning something that feels a bit more abstract, just earning cash, and making it fairly effortless, I think, is such a great idea. And I just also love the connection of those dots and the way that it visually connects. And I just admire the copywriting that goes into this so much. Like you said, it can be fairly complex, and keeping it succinct while still communicating the point is really an art.</p><p><strong>Lori Dennis</strong>: Yeah. In fact, this email I thought was maybe a little too succinct, and so we actually developed a second email around the referral program. And that one is a little bit of a deeper dive with a video that shares real-world examples on how to refer people. So I think it was a really good one-two punch to get the point across and make sure people were understanding how to actually go about referring. And it’s working well. Our program has only been live for less than two months, the new referral program, and it’s going really well.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Yeah. One other theme I wanted to highlight in all these emails is that Going’s tone of voice feels very human to me.</p><p>Share with your friends. You know, this doesn’t feel like work or spam. I think bringing some of that less-than-corporate, jargony speak is definitely beneficial to a brand like this. It really feels like it’s coming from people, and you know, Going is a friend that can help you travel better. So I think that is done really well with all these different sends.</p><p><strong>Lori Dennis</strong>: I’m so glad that’s coming across, because it’s really part of our tone of voice that we are that friend. We’re here to give you good travel tips and help you see the world. Our copywriter does a great job with that.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Oh, we’ve got a couple more to walk through. And this one’s all about Japan economy class. A lot of data points in this one — a lot. So I’m excited to see some of your thoughts on this.</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/2dfed93129434da9be022837be9a55dc""></p><p>(<a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/with-points-japan-economy-class-70k-roundtrip"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">See the full email</a>)</p><p><strong>Justine Jordan</strong>: The reason why I submitted this one was that I was dying to hear from Lori or someone who had a hand in this email about how they make this happen. So I assume a database, sophisticated ESP, lots of testing, or it was like… I don’t know. Look at that giant list of cities, like all of the things that you can do. It’s such a helpful email. So dated, dense with data, but also, I can only imagine what it took to set it up.</p><p><strong>Lori Dennis</strong>: Oh, you picked a tricky one to talk about. Okay. We send out a bunch of different types of deals. We send out deals you can book for cash. We send out deals you can book with points and miles, and this is an example of points and miles. We also have mistake fare deal templates. We have limited and premium deal templates — all kinds. But for the purposes of this example, this is our points and miles deal template, and it is extremely complex, but we don’t want it to seem extremely complex to the end user.</p><p>The whole point of these emails is to help people with something that’s really complicated, which is using your points and miles to actually book travel. This email is all about making use of your points more accessible and really giving someone absolutely everything they need within the body of the email itself to be able to take that trip for free. You know, like points that you’ve earned grocery shopping, filling your tank with gas — literally, you can take those and use them to go to Japan with just this email. Yes. For the purposes of this interview, I talked to our designer and our developer who worked on it. This was designed by Rachel Smith, who’s our Director of Product Design. Most of our emails are designed by our marketing creative team. However, this actually is part of our product. So the product design team worked on this one — a little bit of a new onset at Going. And then it was coded by Jessa Moon, who’s our Senior Marketing Developer.</p><p>Some design notes for you: We really had to give a lot of thought to the hierarchy of this email, because there is so much information to present someone with. And so we started with a snapshot right at the top, and instead of forcing a member to scroll past a wall of information to figure out if this deal would even work for them, we put it all in the snapshot. We give them all the key information right up front: here are the dates, here are the airlines, here are the eligible transfers for points, and here are the routes. And if it doesn’t work for you, move right along. If it does work for you, keep scrolling, and we’ll give you absolutely all the information you need.</p><p>We couldn’t make the email interactive, so scrolling is inevitable. And so we had to really use a hierarchy and sections and a grid-like table system to lay everything out in a way that is easy to figure out and understand. We kept departure and return dates in columns for scanability. It’s so much — so many dates, just tiny little text, and if you don’t know what you’re looking at, it’s going to be really hard to read. So we had to make it make sense even for people who are maybe new to points and miles.</p><p><strong>Justine Jordan</strong>: As a frequent flight booker and points travel nerd, I was just like, wow. This is the most helpful way that you could help me digest what is a very complex topic. And so I just really want to applaud your designer and developer for taking the time to thoughtfully present all of that, along with even the instructions of how to get it done at the bottom.</p><p><strong>Lori Dennis</strong>: We had to give all this information on exactly how they can book the deal on their own. This doesn’t live on our website, at least not right now. So if someone wanted to click through, the only place to link them to with the CTA is to go book it with the airline. So we have to explain how transfers work, how the point breakdowns work, and any extra information they might need to figure out how to navigate that process. The other thing I learned by talking to Jessa, who coded this email, is that the template itself is really simple. There’s one of everything in the template. These are API-triggered by our travel ops team — that’s the team at Going that finds the flight deals, including points and miles deals. They input all the information, and the API triggers this template.</p><p>It leans very heavily on dynamic content and logic statements wrapped around each element. She actually described it in a fun way—it’s kind of like Mad Libs for email. The data pulls in from the API and fills in the blanks. Each block only needs to be coded once, and then it’s duplicated using Liquid for all the different data points that get plugged in.</p><p><strong>Justine Jordan</strong>: I see. This is the magic behind the scenes that we all love to hear about. Thank you for demystifying. Yeah. Like if someone is banging out table after table… but you know, Liquid and API, that all makes a ton of sense.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Yeah. Cool. This is a great use case of live text. Someone might say, oh, this might take a lot of time if I have to export all these images. But like you said, if you can use data and have it flow into a template using a design system and live text, you can bring in a lot of these data points and make it feel really one-to-one and unique without having to recreate or recode the entire email every time.</p><p><strong>Justine Jordan</strong>: And you make it scalable, you operationalize it. And that’s even cooler from the business end of things.</p><p><strong>Lori Dennis</strong>: We had to. I think we support something like close to 200 airports in the US, and so there’s no way we could code each of these manually. It would not make any sense.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: For an impossible task, you really nailed everything. And I really like this snapshot. I feel like more emails or newsletters should have a “too long, didn’t read” or snapshot section summarizing the information.</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/84cf90b2bffe4385aba4b48affc55290""></p><p>(<a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/hey-premium-traveler"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">See the full email</a>)</p><p>Alright, well, now we have some more product-related emails here. It was really interesting to see how the ones we’ve looked at so far are sort of promotional, and now these are a little bit more product-focused, a little bit more transactional, bringing you into onboarding onto the premium or even premium part of your site.</p><p><strong>Lori Dennis</strong>: I love that you used the word onboarding. That’s exactly what this is. We do have onboarding when you first sign up for an account on the website or the app. But this is the first email you receive when you sign up. So we’ve been internally calling this our unboxing email. It’s email number one from our welcome series.</p><p>And while we don’t have a physical product to actually unbox, our membership does include a ton of cool features. So we wanted to make sure that someone signing up for the first time knows right away all the features they have access to and how to get the most from their subscription. Yeah. We’ll start at the top with that progress bar. It’s really complex. It looks simple, but it is not. We have multiple versions of the progress bar based on whether the person has signed up via the website or the app. That was something that took an extraordinarily long time to figure out, but we did it.</p><p>We figured it out. It had to account for a varying number of emails. Somebody might get four emails, somebody might get five emails. You see email two listed there, it says “mobile app.” If they signed up through the app or if we know they already have the app, they’re not getting email two. They’re skipping from email one to three. So yes, we’ve coded that so it works for everyone</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: I’ve seen a few brands do something like this, but never this well done, to be honest. Even on mobile, this is like a chef’s kiss because all these little details really add up and make it feel like such a comprehensive idea around something. But I really like calling out these sections and setting an expectation of how many onboarding emails I’m going to get. Is it going to be thirty? But having it set to five, it kind of feels like, okay, I know what to expect and not feel overwhelmed.</p><p><strong>Lori Dennis</strong>: Yeah. And actually, that fifth one there — points and miles — it does open up a little bit of a door, because that is an additional choose-your-own-adventure series. Once you get that fifth email, you can opt in for an additional points and miles drip campaign, which is a three-part series. It’s basically an in-depth crash course on how to use airline miles and credit card points for travel. It could have been an eight-part welcome series, but that felt really overwhelming. So we kept it at five and gave people the option to opt in for that if they wanted to learn more about points and miles.</p><p><strong>Justine Jordan</strong>: There are two things I love about this. One is that we always talk about personalization in the email world. Too often, that’s like, you know, “percent, percent first name here.” But this is what I see as true personalization, where it’s almost invisible to the user because you’ve coded this and structured your data and your email program in a way where it’s tailored to me. It’s personalized to my experience about whether or not A, I have the mobile app, or B, if I’m really interested in opting into that other series. So I love that the user are in control, and you’ve honored their preferences and the data you have about them in a way that tailors the experience.</p><p><strong>Lori Dennis</strong>: Everything about this email is highly personalized right from the headline, going premium-like.</p><p>We know that you're premium and you're not elite. We have different versions based on what tier you've signed up for. The bright green box right below that: when you go through onboarding and sign up for our product, we ask you what airports you like to fly from, and this personalization lends confidence to the fact that we've captured your inputs during onboarding. We're watching for flights from those preferred airports. And if you only have two listed, like this person here, there's a prompt to add more airports. So we could keep looking. Maybe you've entered a couple of smaller airports that don't get a lot of international flights. We'll prompt you to add some bigger airports, that kind of thing.</p><p>Your watchlist destinations, that section too, are pulling in places that you've told us during onboarding you want to fly to. We're reassuring and also giving you an opportunity to go back into your watchlist right from this email and either add or remove destinations that you've selected.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Yeah. My mind is being blown by every different section again, throughout all these emails. Shout out to the motion graphics here. Everything just feels so clean, so pretty. It's nice, but like you said, Justine, to me email personalization is honestly like every email is almost one-to-one in some way. It's a combination of segmentation and dynamic data and choosing which data points to bring in. This is really smart, just about bringing in what's important to the user. As we said before, knowing your audience and understanding what data points you have, how to segment, how to design, and bring it all together is something that feels really personalized, concise, and useful.</p><p><strong>Lori Dennis</strong>: Yeah. I love how this one translates to mobile, too. It's just so clean. It's such a great IT experience. You don't lose anything by looking at it on mobile at all. There's also that box there with the phone, which is only going to show for members who haven't downloaded the app yet. It's a little prompt. Go get the app in case you didn't know we had one. And if you do that from this email, you won't get email two. Then your progress bar changes. Cool, huh?</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig &amp; Justine Jordan</strong>: Wow.</p><p><strong>Lori Dennis</strong>: We also have expert travel tips throughout this whole welcome series. Again, this is email one of several, and each one features a different travel tip to build trust positioning, going as travel experts. Add a little more information to make people more savvy travelers now that they've joined our membership.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: I definitely advocate for any onboarding to maybe show some faces, have a little FAQ section, make it feel like the purchase you just made or the signup was justified, that someone can help you out, or that there's a lot of information available to guide you through something. When we talk about constraint, I think this feels really concise and as you say, you're breaking it up rather than putting it all into one. All those little elements build trust with the consumer and make this experience feel really great.</p><p><strong>Lori Dennis</strong>: Yeah, and back to the goals of this email: the strategic goals were to generate excitement around a new membership and also educate on our features.</p><p>I think we do a fantastic job of doing both. Don't get me wrong, there's a ton of information packed into this email, but it doesn't feel overwhelming. And I think that was a pretty challenging thing to pull off. I think we did a great job with it.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Cool. I was going to say this is Feedback Friday, but honestly, we have not given much feedback.</p><p><strong>Justine Jordan</strong>: I feel like we're unboxing all of the amazing secrets behind Going's email program.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Alright, we can wrap up with this last little email here: a transactional email just letting people know that their account is going to be renewed. I feel like some people don't want to send an email to say, “Hey, we're gonna charge you money,” but to me, as you said, building trust with an audience means it's good not to surprise someone with a fee and then have to deal with chargebacks or something. So I really appreciated this one as well.</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/50255b1184784b819eb5ec8bf296d99e""></p><p>(<a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/your-going-account-will-renew-soon"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">See the email</a>)</p><p><strong>Lori Dennis</strong>: We aim to always be on the traveler’s side at Going, and a big part of that is maintaining trust. Nobody likes to be hit with surprise membership renewal charges. It's never fun. So we make a point to let members know in advance when exactly their plan will renew and what the charge will be. Some might argue that this reminds people they're about to be charged, and they cancel. Yes, that's always going to be the case with a membership subscription business. But I think on the other side, it's also proven to mitigate churn and help reduce credit card disputes, which is something we track at Going. A lot of people might not realize how harmful a credit card dispute can be for a small business, and if they get hit with a charge they're not expecting, they might not know that they can cancel it. They might just go right to the credit card company and dispute that charge. That comes with all kinds of penalties and fees.</p><p>We work really hard to reduce the number of instances where someone gets surprised with a charge and wants to dispute it. Those are the purposes behind the email. We've tested a few things with it, mainly around when to send it out. Ultimately, we've landed on sending it 30 days before the charge hits, but we’ve also started testing sending a reminder if we know that someone hasn't opened it. Then they get a reminder two weeks later, about 14 days before the charge. That's been going really well, and we have seen credit card disputes go down.</p><p><strong>Justine Jordan</strong>: I love the tie between the email channel and what can be a critical revenue or risk part of the company, and seeing that cross-functional collaboration makes me happy, too.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Awesome. Well, thank you so much for taking the time today. You had a ton of Going emails. We only looked at a small portion of them, so if you are interested, definitely sign up for Going and get all those amazing emails. Thanks again, Lori. Are there any other things you want to plug? Are there any takeaways you want to leave us with?</p><p><strong>Lori Dennis</strong>: Like you just said, if you're interested in receiving some of these emails in your inbox, I encourage you to sign up at <a href=""http://going.com"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">going.com</a>. Our limited tier is always free and includes domestic flight deals within the lower 48 states. You'll also get those great travel newsletters. We looked at a few of those today, so that's a great place to start if you just want to check it out and get your feet wet. But if you are looking to travel internationally, our premium membership more than pays for itself with just one flight booking. So well worth it, in my opinion.</p><p><strong>Justine Jordan</strong>: I know I’ve definitely made good use of some of these deals. And thank you so much for giving us a peek behind the curtain. I love businesses like <a href=""https://www.grammarly.com/browser/chrome"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Grammarly</a> that always stood out to me as a company where email was the product. I didn’t have to log into the website hardly ever because I got so much value from the emails. To celebrate the power of the channel by creating a whole business around the product, being an email is just so cool to me. Thank you for giving us a peek behind the various aspects of the Going product.</p><p><strong>Lori Dennis</strong>: Absolutely. Thank you so much for having me. I love geeking out over emails with you two. And yeah, let's do it again. We have a bazillion emails to showcase, so I'd love to do this again with you sometime.</p><p><strong>Justine Jordan</strong>: Oh yeah, let's get your designer and developer on here so we can really dig into the details.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: That sounds good.

The featured brand was <a href=""https://wuffes.com/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Wuffes</a>, which makes supplements for dogs with a special focus on joint health. Together, we reviewed&nbsp;<strong>four lifecycle emails</strong>, highlighting both what worked well and areas where there was room for optimization.</p><p>👇 Keep reading for all the juicy insights from the night.</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/c5173809b3a343a0bfae71bfeda0cb99"">(<a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/take-5-off-your-first-wuffes-order"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">See the full email</a>)</p><h2><strong>Email 1 — Welcome + $5 off</strong></h2><p>The first touchpoint opens with a <strong>$5 discount hero</strong>. It’s an immediate, clear incentive, but the accompanying line—<em>“it’s still not too late to start helping your pup”</em>—sets a surprisingly dark and anxious tone for what should be a welcoming introduction.</p><p>The <strong>product grid</strong> is one of the strongest sections: products are paired with concise descriptions, bullet points, and specific CTAs, such as <em>“shop joint chews.”</em> This makes it easy for new subscribers to explore the range.</p><p>However, issues undermine trust and accessibility:</p><ul><li><strong>Inconsistent proof numbers</strong> (“330,000 happy pup parents” in one section vs. “770,000” later).</li><li><strong>Centered paragraphs</strong> that reduce readability and pose challenges for readers with dyslexia.</li><li class=""ql-indent-1"">In fact, one audience member noted how some restaurants intentionally <strong>center-align menus</strong> to make it harder to compare prices—a reminder that centered text = more cognitive friction.</li><li><strong>Subscription copy</strong> that highlights <em>“58¢ a day”</em> instead of a clearer percentage discount.</li><li>A confusing <strong>“X” icon</strong> that suggests a modal close but isn’t functional.</li><li><br></li></ul><p>Despite these hiccups, the offer and product layout are conversion-friendly. What’s missing is tone alignment, text clarity, and a consistent proof framework.</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong> Strong discount and product grid, but Wuffes could improve by adopting a friendlier tone, left-aligning copy for accessibility, clarifying subscription savings, and keeping proof numbers consistent.</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/39179629fd514a14a4dff1b4e25ba9e6"">(<a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/welcome-to-the-wuffes-pack"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">See the full email</a>)</p><h2><strong>Email 2 — “Welcome to the Pack”</strong></h2><p>This follow-up email leads with playful illustrations and a mission-driven headline. The intent is warm, but the <strong>“Learn more” CTA</strong> feels vague and poorly connected to the hero copy.</p><p>The <strong>founder story</strong> is a bright spot: Two succinct bullet points paired with a dog photo make it authentic and relatable, a rare example of founder content done well.</p><p>But from there, the email loses focus:</p><ul><li><strong>Repetition</strong> of differentiators already introduced in the first touch.</li><li><strong>Inconsistent copy</strong> like “vet recommended” vs. “vet approved.”</li><li><strong>All-caps CTAs</strong> that feel visually loud and unfriendly to screen readers.</li><li><strong>Subscription confusion</strong> between subscribing to emails and subscribing to products.</li></ul><p>Visuals (e.g., dogs interacting with the product) are strong, but the structure and language require streamlining. Another missed opportunity: the <strong>site CTA color</strong> is a strong tennis-ball green, but the button color in emails is inconsistent. Using it more would improve the hierarchy, but it should be&nbsp;<strong>tested</strong>&nbsp;<strong>in dark mode,</strong>&nbsp;as neon hues can lose contrast or vibrate on dark backgrounds.</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong> The founder story works well, but this email could be strengthened with specific CTAs, reduced repetition, clearer distinctions between email and product subscriptions, and consistent button usage (tested across both dark/light modes).</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/77f27ec82b464194a723069c3dcbdf1a""></p><p>(<a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/are-double-servings-needed-for-your-pup"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">See the full email</a>)</p><h2><strong>Email 3 — Double servings</strong></h2><p>This educational piece tackles the concept of “double servings.” The subject line asks the right question—<em>“Are double servings needed for your pup?”</em>—but the hero leads with <em>“You asked. We answered.”</em> The result: the actual question appears further down, diluting clarity.</p><p>Other friction points:</p><ul><li><strong>Charts are image-only</strong>, scale poorly on mobile devices, and are inaccessible to screen readers.</li><li>A <strong>blog CTA appears too early</strong>, sending readers out of the email before the main explanation is delivered.</li><li>The <strong>most persuasive block—pricing/value reassurance—has no CTA underneath it.</strong></li><li>The hero image (a slim dog with an empty bowl) visually contradicts the “double servings” message.</li></ul><p>There are wins too: the color-blocking works well to break up sections and guide attention. But the overall flow could be re-ordered to surface the main question first, keep readers in the email, and tie value to conversion moments.</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong> This is a good educational approach, but Wuffes could strengthen this email by surfacing the key question upfront, making the data text-based, and placing CTAs under the strongest value blocks.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/4b9e3ee0b551439198e88e0683cc50dd""></p><p>(<a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/we-noticed-you-had-your-eye-on-this"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">See the full email</a>)</p><h2><strong>Email 4 — Abandoned cart</strong></h2><p>This abandoned cart email opens with a <strong>long, hedged headline</strong> about results <em>“in as little as 3 weeks”</em>—complete with an asterisk. Instead of inspiring confidence, it raises doubt. Later, urgency is conveyed in the phrase&nbsp;<em>“claim your offer before it’s too late”</em>—but with no prior setup, it comes across as alarmist.</p><p>The <strong>product block</strong> is visually well-designed, but it lacks essential elements: there is no pricing information, no comparison between one-time and subscription options, and no reinforcement of the $5 discount.</p><p>The email has standout elements that should be highlighted:</p><ul><li><strong>Social proof from a vet</strong> (“incredible results with my patients and my own pet”) is buried mid-email.</li><li>A delightful <strong>team-dog favorites section</strong> humanizes the brand and builds trust, but comes late instead of leading.</li></ul><p>Meanwhile, consistency issues persist:</p><ul><li>Numbers fluctuate again (330k, 770k, 400k).</li><li>Styles shift (all caps, countdowns, inconsistent guarantees).</li><li>Microcopy like “90 day” vs. “90-day” isn’t standardized.</li></ul><p>It feels like too many contributors touched the template without a final QA pass, leaving it disjointed. Other live observations worth noting:</p><ul><li>The <strong>GIF</strong> of a dog climbing stairs loaded slowly on café Wi-Fi, which accidentally made the urgency CTA feel more like a real countdown. At normal speed, the connection between GIF and urgency felt weaker.</li><li>One suggestion from the room was to swap out alarmist urgency with a softer, curiosity-driven CTA, such as <strong>“Check remaining inventory”</strong>—a gentler way to leverage scarcity.</li><li>The CTA colors again didn’t align with the&nbsp;<strong>green site buttons</strong>; consistency here would enhance the hierarchy.</li></ul><p><strong>Summary:</strong> This abandoned cart has strong assets, but Wuffes could boost conversion by moving social proof higher, showing clear pricing comparisons, applying urgency more credibly (or reframing it as “check inventory availability”), and ensuring consistent style and language.</p><h2><strong>Key takeaways</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Lead with empathy</strong>, not alarm. Frame <strong>urgency</strong> only when a real <strong>deadline</strong> exists.</li><li><strong>Make scanning effortless</strong>. <strong>Left-align text</strong>, use <strong>bullets</strong> wisely, and keep <strong>CTAs</strong> live-text and specific.</li><li>Stay <strong>consistent</strong>. Align <strong>proof numbers</strong>, <strong>claims</strong>, and <strong>microcopy</strong> across all templates.</li><li>Show clear <strong>pricing</strong>. Compare <strong>one-time vs. subscription</strong> in key conversion moments.</li><li><strong>Humanize and segment</strong>. Use authentic <strong>testimonials</strong> and tailor content for <strong>vets vs. pet parents</strong>.</li><li>Test <strong>simplicity</strong> and <strong>design</strong>. Shorter <strong>copy</strong>, one strong <strong>CTA</strong>, and consistent <strong>brand colors</strong> (QA’d in <strong>dark mode</strong>) often win.</li></ul><h2><strong>Wrapping up</strong></h2><p>This Feedback Friday Live at Single Slice once again showed why our community matters.

For Better Brand, it comes down to bold design, sharp storytelling, and a touch of food tech innovation. Known for reinventing the classic bagel with high protein, low carbs, and plant-based ingredients, the brand brings that same “too good to be true” energy into the inbox.</p><p>In this episode of Feedback Friday, Matt Helbig chats with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/alissataggart/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Alissa Taggart</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/virasadlak/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Vira Sadlak </a>from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/company/flowium/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Flowium</a> to explore the strategy behind Better Brand’s standout emails — from welcome flows that educate and convert to sleek subscription and social push campaigns that keep the brand top of mind.</p><p>They share how thoughtful design choices, such as live text for accessibility, balanced visuals, and motion-driven storytelling, help create emails that look good enough to eat and perform just as well.

So, perhaps a quick insight into the brand itself. Better Brand created the Better Bagel, which is almost a “too good to be true” version of the bagel. Everyone I know loves bagels. If you don’t, I’m sorry, that’s kind of strange to me. Anyway, bagels are usually high in carbs and sugar, and pretty low in protein. It’s that guilty pleasure where you really want one, you eat it, and then you feel terrible later. With Better Brand, their bagel actually contains 26 grams of protein, 5 grams of net carbs, and 1 gram of sugar. You think about that and you’re like, “Sorry, come again?” And they’re actually good. They’re fluffy and nice, and they kind of taste like a normal bagel. They’re totally plant-based, which is awesome. Better Brand is in the food tech space. Amy Yang is the founder, and she’s a very, very cool woman. If you ever have the chance to read about her, definitely do, because she has one heck of a brain to come up with something like this.</p><p>Their focus is on people who are more forward-thinking and innovative, who fit within the food tech world, and who want to live a pleasurable life without guilt, shame, or the unnecessary additives that can be found in many products. People who are focused on living a good life without forsaking or compromising the things they enjoy. Their main focus is on forward thinkers —people who are truly innovative, those who want to break boundaries in a positive way that excites and energizes others. There was a lot of back and forth between our agency team and theirs to fully understand and refine the look and feel of these emails. It took some time, but we eventually arrived. If you check out their website, it’s also really cool.</p><p>Whenever we create emails, we strive to strike a balance between reflecting the website and representing what the brand stands for, as a direct replica can feel somewhat boring. We feel like we’ve hit the nail on the head, and it’s great to hear that these emails are really popular on the Really Good Emails website and that you're enjoying them. I'm excited to walk through some of these and discuss the cool elements. Huge shout-out to our senior designer at Flowium, Luis. He’s based in Puerto Rico. The skill this person possesses is amazing. We sent the brand over to him, and we were like, “Please help. We need to revamp what’s going on. We’re going back and forth.” He came back with these designs, and everyone on our team, including the client, was like, “What just happened? This is amazing.” So we ran with it and here we are. Very excited to talk about these.</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/77c0c2ccf9be40849fc2d9eb8c60869a""></p><p>(<a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/whats-in-our-bagels"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">See the full email</a>)</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Awesome. Yes, this seems like a welcome onboarding email that walks through their product, and I’m really impressed by the balance between live text and imagery. In a lot of templates we feature from your agency, it’s great to see how much live text you include. Many DTC brands typically end up creating one large Photoshop export and incorporating it into a template, but seeing these utilize live text and offer a bit more accessibility is awesome.</p><p><strong>Alissa Taggart</strong>: Yeah, there’s a lot of thought behind that. Our timelines tend to be a bit longer than those offered by most agencies, because we focus on bringing the brand to life within an email, while prioritizing deliverability. However, this can be compromised when all emails are image-based. Sometimes the images don’t show, and sometimes the emails get clipped. It becomes pretty problematic. Our designers strive to strike the perfect balance between engaging imagery and live text. That way, the emails flow well, are easier for customers to interact with and look at, are easier to receive, and don’t negatively impact deliverability in the long run. That is a huge focus for us at our agency.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Awesome. First off, even this copy, this first name right here, stood out to me. I kept thinking, “Is that my name or not?” But yeah, this is really great copy. And I was like, “Did they really use bagels for the bullet points?” That immediately elevates this email to a new level. Awesome to see.</p><p><strong>Alissa Taggart</strong>: Yeah, this one’s exciting. And just so you know, this was the original design we created. The client was kind of like, “This feels a little off-brand.” We have a couple of others queued up, but this is really good because you can see the evolution from where we started to where we ended up. I love the simplicity. The background, the bagel bullet points. Several elements throughout the email are noteworthy. It’s interactive and engaging. We break down all the ingredients, not in a boring, back-to-back manner, but in a way that's much more visual for customers.</p><p>This part, as well, where you can see the difference between something that’s Better and something that’s Vintage, is awesome too. It is that direct visual comparison for customers. A significant portion of what we observed is that you are dealing with two major camps.</p><p>Customers who respond really well to lots of text and plain text, versus customers who respond really well to lots of imagery, understand in more depth what the brand is about, what the product is about, and how it looks in comparison to other things. The comparison emails and elements that we add to many of our clients’ emails are always where people engage the most, which is really interesting. And it makes sense. We always want to see why we should buy this versus just buying what we’ve always bought. It is certainly helpful for the consumer.</p><p><strong>Vira Sadlak</strong>: It’s the fun fact portion for me. I love all the bagel bullet points, like “the same amount of sugar as one stalk of celery.” I’m like, what? How is that even possible? It’s very informational, and that’s what I like about it. Usually, brands neglect that first email. They treat it more as, “Hey, thank you for subscribing, you’ve been added to the list.” However, this is your chance to tell more about your brand and its values, to get your customers hooked. Don’t underestimate it. This email is one where we see a lot of conversion in those very first few emails of the welcome flow.</p><p><strong>Alissa Taggart</strong>: And I love the GIF at the top, the way the bagel rolls in, kind of like, “Hi, I am here,” and then underneath it says, “Consider the grain changed,” and you’re like, whoa, this bagel has made a statement. I love GIFs that play along with the copy. That always makes it better.</p><p><strong>Vira Sadlak</strong>: Yeah, and the copy is just as important as the design in this one, and in all of them. They did a great job staying on point with the brand's voice and visual representation.</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/07120b0e7c284e3d9d095f14007405e9""></p><p>(<a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/end-the-month-with-everything"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">See the full email</a>)</p><p><strong>Alissa Taggart</strong>: I know. That’s another thing we focused on extensively with the client. They were like, “We need these emails to look good enough to eat,” and I think Luis was like, “Check.” You can see the evolution of where we went with the design and the emails. It is not necessarily darker, but there is a certain mystery to the black, which is fused with the red. It makes it edgier and more mysterious. There is a cool vibe to it. It feels like, “I have to buy this bagel so I can be part of the cool kids club who are eating these bagels too.”</p><p>The imagery helps. There’s one picture I always think of, a bagel with butter and sliced bananas with honey drizzled all over it. You look at it and you’re like, this is amazing. That is what we wanted to focus on. There is the edginess and the innovation side of things, where eating these bagels puts you in that camp. But they are also delicious. We don’t want to take away from that by hyper-focusing on “it’s healthy.” When people see green all the time, you’re kind of like, okay. But when you see green with delicious, then you’re like, 'Aha, we've found the sweet spot.'</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Yeah, it definitely creates some bagel FOMO and makes a healthier option really appealing. You do a really good job of creating a sense of wanting to be part of this product. Everything is extremely clean, with a well-organized footer and clear text and imagery. Very nice work on this.</p><p><strong>Alissa Taggart</strong>: Luis did this interesting thing with the arrow. When I first saw it I was like, I don’t really get it. However, as you scroll through the email, it becomes clear. It makes you focus on whatever the arrow is pointing at, which is important information. This email is intended to inform recipients about the benefits of our subscription. We’re also offering a subscription discount to sign up. This was leading up to National Bagel Day, which I think was January 15. I don’t know why I remember these random dates, but here we are. So the arrow, I wasn’t sure at first. Then, when I scrolled through and eventually received it in my inbox, I was like, This small detail makes all the difference. Without it, I’ve seen it, and you kind of get lost. You see “Subscriber perks,” and there are four bagels, and you wonder where you are going. With the arrow, it makes sense.</p><p><strong>Vira Sadlak</strong>: Yeah, it totally makes sense. I mean, yeah, especially in the mobile version, right? When all you can see is the bagel and you’re like, okay, I guess it’s the end of the email. However, the arrow design also looks visually appealing. It has that white color.</p><p>It puts everything together, links everything together, and combines the black, the white, the red, and a hint of white. Yeah, it’s beautiful. It’s very high-end. You know what I mean? And that’s pretty much the message that we are trying to deliver with this brand.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Yeah. So you mentioned maybe your timelines are taking a little bit longer. How long does it usually take to make an email like this? Because, to be honest, the desktop and mobile versions look fantastic and seem really well-optimized. From kickoff to the email actually going out, how long would you say that is?</p><p><strong>Alissa Taggart</strong>: I would say it’s anywhere between three to four weeks. That’s our typical timeline, from creating the campaign strategy to rolling it out to our entire team. However, in reality, if our team worked on only one client, it would probably take us three days. This is because, for designers, creating a campaign from scratch and producing something beautiful like this typically takes around two to three hours. We are currently working on condensing timelines within our agency. However, with this client, we often do a lot of last-minute work for them. Shout out to Amy and Rachel. I love working with you guys, by the way, so there’s no offense in what I’m saying. But because they’re such a fresh new company, everything is moving so quickly, and they’re putting all these things in place because they want to maximize all the attention they’re getting right now, which is totally understandable.</p><p>So a lot of their emails actually... for example, we have one email that we’re starting now. I just pushed the copy today, and it needs to go out next Thursday. And it’s doable. I think our team gets a little stressed out with me sometimes, but we do make exceptions for certain companies that are new, fresh, and moving fast. It’s not something that we like to do as a long-term habit, but yeah, it is doable. With many of these Better Brand campaigns, we tend to turn things around much quicker than our normal timeline.</p><p>So it’s immensely impressive. It’s a big part of it. Yeah, I wish I could take any credit for it. I literally can’t take any credit whatsoever. I come up with something like, “We should do a campaign for subscribers,” and then I send it to our copywriter, and he comes up with this amazing idea. Then it gets sent to Luis in design, and I’m like, how did you guys do this? I wrote three words, and you guys just got it. It’s amazing, and it's all happening in such a short time as well.</p><p><strong>Vira Sadlak</strong>: Right. A significant portion of that time is also spent on testing. We test every email thoroughly. Pretty much everyone who works with email double- or triple-checks everything. We run it through, I think, Email on Acid. I’m not sure if we’re still using it or not, but we’re checking every email we send — the flow, the campaign. We double-check all the links, send ourselves a preview, and test it on various devices, including tablets and phones, as well as different screen designs. It’s super important to do all that because there’s always some little thing that makes all the difference, right?</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Yeah, it definitely shows. We have two last ones, if you could walk through them quickly. Alright, so this one is a social media push email, which is becoming more popular. I feel like we’ve been seeing dedicated social media and, even more recently, SMS-dedicated emails. So maybe, why would someone want to send an email like this?</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/17f586a58e3d4c4aac2500e5d5d249eb""></p><p>(<a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/its-better-on-social"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">See the full email</a>)</p><p><strong>Alissa Taggart</strong>: As much as it may upset us to think, email isn’t always for everyone. It’s really beneficial for us to have the opportunity to direct customers or potential customers to different marketing avenues or channels, so they can see everything you’re doing and how engaged you are. But also, if for whatever reason they opt out of email or unfollow you on Instagram, there are still two or three other channels where they’re connected to you. So you’re still communicating with them no matter what.</p><p>Ultimately, you want to be top of mind for these customers. So, even if I’m not buying a Better Bagel every single day, seeing them every day on my Instagram feed makes a lasting impression in my mind. Even when I’m not purposefully thinking about them, they pop up. Now, when I see a bagel, I automatically think Better Brand — A, because I work with them, but also because I see them so frequently on different marketing channels. They’re always top of mind, to the point where now I’m talking to my husband like, “We need to buy a Better Bagel. We need to.” And he’s like, “Why?” And I’m like, “I don’t know, we just need to. My subconscious is telling me because I’ve had so many touchpoints with the brand.”</p><p>That definitely helps. The more touchpoints, the better. Vera and I have discussed this extensively on our podcast as well. It takes, I think, up to 17 touchpoints — and that’s for lower-value items — for someone to finally buy. And the touchpoint isn’t just going to happen in email. It’s going to happen in email, on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, word of mouth, direct mail — any way that you can connect with the consumer, you want to do it. So yeah, this email is interesting. At first, we thought, “Social push, okay,” but then we actually did it, and there was a really good response. Their Instagram following is increasing pretty drastically. They’re very active on their stories, too. Social media gives these brands the opportunity to be more witty, funny, and sly, whereas email requires a more professional tone. You can still be funny, obviously, but you’re trying to be more like, “This is who we are.” Then on Instagram, you can be like, “Yo, what up girl?” — like sliding into your DMs kind of thing. So it’s fun because people can see the different personalities of your brand.</p><p><strong>Vira Sadlak</strong>: But it also gives you a sense of community, too, which you can’t necessarily get through email. On Instagram, you can engage with other bagel fans and with the brand directly. It puts a human face on the brand and on the community, which is very important. I really like, Alissa, was it you or I — I think it was someone from the conference — who compared the brand’s different marketing platforms. They said that email marketing is like the good guy your mom wants you to marry.</p><p><strong>Alissa Taggart</strong>: It was Robbie Fitzwater. He was actually a speaker at the conference. He said that email marketing is like that guy your parents really wanted you to date in high school, but you didn’t want to, because he wasn’t the sexy, cool guy with the leather jacket and the motorcycle. Email marketing was like the nerdy guy who’s obviously going places but keeps to himself, doesn’t go out much on Saturday nights, a solid good guy. And you’re just like, no. Then, when you grow up, you realize you should have dated that guy.</p><p><strong>Vira Sadlak</strong>: And social media is that other guy.</p><p><strong>Alissa Taggart</strong>: Yeah, the bad boy kind of guy, you know?</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Alright, well last one. This exit intent offer — I think I might have actually gotten an email like this or a similar one — is kind of like an abandoned cart email, right?</p><p><strong>Alissa Taggart</strong>: Sort of. The way the exit intent offer works for us is that we only allow it to appear on a product page. It’s only when someone has shown a legitimate intent to purchase, as evidenced by their presence on a product page, not just browsing through the site. So, if you’re on a particular product page and then move your mouse or cursor off the browser with the intention to exit, a pop-up appears. For Better Brand, the pop-up offer is “Buy three, get one free.” When someone opts in, they get this email. This is the first email in the flow. Then, we implement a stacked incentive. The first two emails will be this one and a reminder of the offer, as our offers typically last only 48 hours.</p><p>Then we include a welcome email or more information about the brand to help people take the next step. The next two emails will include a better incentive, such as free shipping or a completely different offer altogether. That will be the offer, and then a reminder will follow. That’s usually how we frame our exit intent. So this sort of acts like a welcome flow, because people didn’t opt in through the homepage pop-up. It’s still a crucial time to put your best foot forward and showcase your brand to customers.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Yeah, just quickly on the design of this one, I really like how you called out this code here. I think that’s really smart, almost making it the same pill-style CTA that really matches and brings your eye down. I also appreciate that, in this case, you left-align the text rather than centering it, simply because it’s a bit longer. I’m a big fan of this type of email. How important are emails like this? Do most brands need to have some sort of intent offer or abandoned cart email to capture those sales?</p><p><strong>Alissa Taggart</strong>: The exit intent flow tends to be one of the top three performing flows for all of our clients, revenue-wise. Engagement as well, but revenue — and that’s what clients care about — is like, where’s the money at? Exit intent is definitely one of those places, as it’s usually an offer given again to someone who already has the intent to purchase. They’re right there, and then you offer them that as a last resort, sort of like, 'Please stay on the site, make a purchase, here you go.' And again, it makes the consumer work a little bit harder for the discount because they’ve actually had to get to the product page. Not that it takes that long — it’s, what, three seconds to go from a homepage to a product page — but they’ve had to do a little more research and look through the site a bit more, to really go through the product description, details, and so on.</p><p>I would argue that this is a crucial aspect of any email marketing strategy from a holistic perspective. Out of every single flow, the most important, in my opinion, would definitely be a welcome flow, because you want to make sure customers know what they’re opting into. Then, for me, the next steps would be an abandoned cart flow and a post-purchase flow. That’s my own personal ranking — but honestly, it’s like picking a favorite child. It’s hard.</p><p><strong>Vira Sadlak</strong>: It’s literally picking the favorite one. But also, it’s not the same for every brand. There are some brands that don’t do discounts at all, for example, but you can still give some sort of incentive to your customers. Maybe it’s something like exclusive desktop wallpapers — I think it was Glossier who did that — or a PDF, or an invitation to an exclusive Facebook group that’s only available to certain customers. You want to give them some sort of incentive, but obviously, it all comes down to your overall marketing strategy.</p><p><strong>Alissa Taggart</strong>: And it doesn’t always have to be an offer, like Vira said. It can be something that gives people an inside scoop into the brand, so they have a deeper understanding. For example, this is more service-based, but many personal trainers with websites will use exit intent not as an offer, but as exit intent content. Something like, “Hey, before you leave, make sure you get your free three-day guide on how to lose 10 pounds,” or whatever it is. That’s a way for them to stay engaged, receive your email, and also provide some value in return. So really, the exit intent is just an additional way to transactionally switch value. Like, I will give if you give me your email so I can contact you, and I will give you this thing. That’s really what it’s all about. The exit intent just provides another option for that as well.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Fantastic. Thank you so much for reviewing these emails. How can people maybe work with you? I’m not sure. Are you still accepting new clients?</p><p><strong>Alissa Taggart</strong>: Yes, totally, totally, totally. Visit our website, and then, when you navigate to “About Us,” you can schedule a call with our team. We’re very straightforward. The way we function is that if we don’t think we’d be a good fit for you, we won’t work with you. As much as we like making money, it’s really important that we’re the right fit. Next, you’ll hop on a call with a member of our sales team. They’ll walk you through what you’re doing as a brand, what your goals are, and if it’s something we can viably add value to, then yes, we can move forward from there. But if not, we’ll let you know right off the bat, like, “Hey, this is probably not a good fit. Here are some other agencies that we’d recommend.” Ultimately, for us, email marketing is extremely important, as most of you are aware. However, if we can’t do it, we’ll offer someone else to do it for you, because everyone should have a solid email marketing strategy in place.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Great. Well, thank you so much, Alissa and Vera. Have a fantastic rest of your day. Thank you, it’s been a real joy to talk to you about these emails. Thank you.</p>",mtthlbg,mtthlbg,,,"Thu, 16 Oct 2025 22:00:00 GMT"

Welcome back to another episode of Feedback Friday. We are back with an amazing episode featuring Julia from Hims &amp; Hers. What's up, Julia? How are you?</p><p><strong>Julia Papanek:</strong> I'm good. How are you?</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Good! So you are the lead email developer and designer at Hims &amp; Hers. Could you talk a little bit about what your day-to-day looks like?</p><p><strong>Julia Papanek:</strong> Yeah. So I've been with Hims &amp; Hers for over three years at this point. I handle all aspects of email development and design at the company. Every email you see these days is designed or coded by me, with a little help from one of our junior designers who’s currently being trained.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: So what is Hims &amp; Hers, for people who might not know?</p><p><strong>Julia Papanek:</strong> Hims &amp; Hers is a telemedicine company. We have prescription products and also over-the-counter products, and everything is handled 100% online.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Nice. Yes, I feel like you're definitely growing. We've been following your emails. We did a previous Feedback Friday with you before, but it's fun to come back and see what you’ve been up to.</p><p><strong>Julia Papanek:</strong> Yeah, you did a Feedback Friday with my predecessor about three years ago, so this feels like a nice evolution.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Let’s talk about this first one. This email has been extremely popular over the last couple of weeks, garnering a significant number of views and collections on the site. What do you think makes this one really good? What kind of stands out to you?</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/fe6867a9fd0947b29bebc5eff413ab4b"">(<a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/unlock-fuller-thicker-hair-your-journey-begins-now"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">See the full email</a>)</p><p><strong>Julia Papanek:</strong> The really beautiful imagery is a standout feature, and the short, center-aligned copy is always effective for a more promotional email. The goal for this one is to promote Hair Rx to prospective customers, so there’s a big, bold, eye-catching headline, followed by brief copy, and then beautiful lifestyle imagery. Below that, a secondary module highlights our products while showcasing some of our key value propositions, including 24/7 support and trusted ingredients.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Yeah, I really like this one. Looking back up, you have a kind of upside-down pyramid that draws your eye toward the “Get Started” CTA, which is a pretty effective call-to-action. One of the rules we’ve covered in the series is the “three-line” rule for center text: anything past three lines gets harder to read. It’s cool that both your headline and subhead stick to that—it looks great on both desktop and mobile.</p><p><strong>Julia Papanek:</strong>&nbsp;Funny story about that headline. This was an older email that our lifecycle marketing team repurposed. Sometimes they edit the copy themselves to save dev and design bandwidth. I think the original copy was shorter, which is why it was so large; when they replaced it with longer text, it became extremely large. We were a little surprised when we saw that come through, but it’s definitely eye-catching.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>:&nbsp;Hey, we like big headlines—big text, the bigger the better!</p><p><strong>Julia Papanek:</strong>&nbsp;It fits the “maximizing” message. It’s a very maximized headline.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>:&nbsp;Exactly. I like this section here. It’s pretty responsive on mobile. Do you know if most people on your list view emails on mobile or desktop?</p><p><strong>Julia:</strong> Most people view on mobile.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Cool. When reviewing emails, we always try to check the mobile view—it’s almost mobile-first now, since more than 50% of users access it on mobile. It’s beneficial to have experience in both.</p><p><strong>Julia Papanek:</strong>&nbsp;Definitely. Having a seamless mobile experience is essential.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>:&nbsp;I also like the little hover effects on desktop. It’s a fun touch if you have time—it adds something extra.</p><p><strong>Julia Papanek:</strong> We have that coded into all of our templates, so you’ll see that hover effect throughout many of our emails.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>:&nbsp;Nice. Sometimes I just tweak the opacity hover on images to show they’re clickable. I'm not saying you need to add that, but it's just a fun suggestion.</p><p><strong>Julia Papanek:</strong> That’s a great suggestion. I love that.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>:&nbsp;Cool. The footer is pretty simple here, and for a medical-oriented company, it’s nice that you keep it clean—simple text and those privacy and terms-of-service links. It’s great not to overload the footer with legal copy if you don’t have to.</p><p><strong>Julia Papanek:</strong>&nbsp;We try to keep it sleek and customer-focused. The terms and conditions are always available, but organized neatly at the bottom. When possible, if there’s an important disclaimer, we’ll move it up into the body near the relevant content. But for this one, it worked best at the bottom.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Nice. Would you make any changes to this one or test anything new?</p><p><strong>Julia Papanek:</strong>&nbsp;One nice thing is that the lifestyle image is a PNG, and the background color is coded. In dark mode, the colors invert, but the image remains consistent. The hover effect idea is great and easy to implement, so we’d definitely add it.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: We’ve discussed live text before. Many beauty brands don’t use it. Is there a push for live text at Hims &amp; Hers?</p><p><strong>Julia Papanek:</strong>&nbsp;Yes. Hims &amp; Hers has never done image-based emails to my knowledge. It’s important for accessibility and a clean experience. Hand-coded emails do that better than image-based ones. Some brands opt for an image-based approach if they don’t have a developer or need to move faster, but since we have the resources, we dedicate time to coding. It also facilitates A/B testing, as we can easily modify copy or images in HTML. That’s not as simple with image-based emails.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Yeah, like when someone edits the headline—it’s harder if it’s locked in an image. Okay, so this next one has a really eye-catching GIF. I love it. I’m not always a fan of using text in GIFs, but this one grabs your attention and leads you down the email nicely. What do you think about it?</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/fba5a18238ec476f92e9612d96b84e4f"">(<a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/just-dropped-hard-mints-by-hims"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">See the full email</a>)</p><p><strong>Julia Papanek:</strong>&nbsp;I love this email. It was a launch for our new Hard Mints product. I worked on the GIF with one of our motion designers, Carolyn Crenshaw. It was essential to demonstrate how the tin works—it’s one of the key differentiators. It’s not a typical ED pill; it’s a hard mint, so it’s more fun and playful. Showing the tin sliding open and revealing the mints was essential for the launch.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> Definitely grabs your eye. Again, that upside-down pyramid toward the CTA looks great. I also like this breakout section—it’s live text rather than an image, which is better for readability, especially on mobile.</p><p><strong>Julia Papanek:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, and on mobile, the image flips to make it smoother for the customer. It’s better to keep live text, so if the image doesn’t display, you don’t lose key information.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> These emails are concise and to the point. Do you try to keep them brief even when they’re promotional?</p><p><strong>Julia Papanek:</strong> Yes. Our copywriters excel at conveying the message with precision and brevity. People scan emails; they don’t want to read a lot. We keep it brief but clear, often using bullet points for scannability.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> Yeah, the checkboxes help a lot with that. And often the goal is simply to get the click to the landing page, where people can learn more or make a purchase.</p><p><strong>Julia Papanek:</strong> Exactly. We tested adding a value props module at the bottom—24/7 chat support, provider-trusted ingredients, and so on—and it performed well. A slightly longer format with value props resonated with readers.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> When would someone receive this email in the flow?</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/d4f9ca059baa4f1db1408da85c337bac"">(<a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/your-questions-answered"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">See the full email</a>)</p><p><strong>Julia Papanek: </strong>It’s part of our “visit pending” series, which is like an abandoned cart. If someone starts but doesn’t finish an online visit for ED medication, they enter this series.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>Nice. Yeah, I really like this type of email. I feel like it definitely solves a customer problem. I think sometimes with brands, they only focus on the promotional stuff and they're really just speaking to that audience. However, this one feels almost like a dialogue with those Q&amp;A sections, and it’s definitely easy to read. Bringing your FAQ content into a simpler form within an email is really beneficial, I think.</p><p><strong>Julia Papanek: </strong>So this was when I worked with one of our junior designers, who I’m mentoring on email design right now, named Savannah McCann. She did a great job working on this email. We tried to strike a good balance between it feeling marketing-oriented but also a little more transactional. We have pops of color, which feel fun and more in line with our promotional communications, but it’s still fairly content-forward. We maintain the gray, white, and black theme, making it easy for customers to digest and derive value from the Q&amp;As.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>And then, I guess, how do you discover that an email like this should exist in the flow?</p><p><strong>Julia Papanek: </strong>That's from doing a lot of customer research and really digging into the data, which our lifecycle marketing managers are great at. They know what the hesitations are along the process — the reasons someone might drop off in the “visit pending” flow and not complete a visit. So they create emails that target those hesitations and try to speak to them at the customer level.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>I definitely like emails that help people along the customer journey. It demonstrates that a brand is considering its relationship with the customer and is attempting to provide additional information.</p><p><strong>Julia Papanek: </strong>Exactly. Because there are some customers who are ready to proceed and will sign up immediately. However, others require a bit more time and information, so we strive to provide it to them in the most digestible manner</p><p>.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>Do you have a more traditional abandoned cart-type email, or are they more informationally focused?</p><p><strong>Julia Papanek: </strong>We have different “abandoned cart”-like visit pending series for our different products. Each one is tailored to that specific product and addresses the particular questions, concerns, or information people may want to know along their journey. They’re all focused on those prescription products and speak directly to them.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>And what platform do you guys use for your email flows?</p><p><strong>Julia Papanek: </strong>We use Braze.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>Braze. Cool. Nice. It appears that someone has made a purchase. Could you talk a bit about the strategy behind this one?</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/2f6592f1240e4b55b19bccd1e4c7d6be"">(<a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/your-order-is-confirmed"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">See the full email</a>)</p><p><strong>Julia Papanek: </strong>So this is our order confirmation email. It goes out to the customer right after they sign up for their first prescription order. This one specifically is for our mental health customers. We really try at the top to strike a balance between it feeling transactional while also welcoming them to the brand. We’re affirming the decision they’ve made with the headline copy. Below that, we reinforce it with some value props — all the benefits that come with their subscription. Then, of course, we include the transactional details — anything they might want to know about the order they’ve just made. At the bottom, there’s a module for help if they’re unsure where to go or have any questions. We try to make it super easy.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>I definitely like that kind of post-purchase receipt that’s a little more welcoming to the brand and a little more informational. I like when brands do something like this — after you give them money, they still reach out with information and additional touchpoints before and after your order is delivered, creating a post-purchase experience.</p><p><strong>Julia Papanek: </strong>Yeah, it’s always important to keep nurturing the customer relationship. This was part of a full redesign of our transactional emails. Those emails had needed some love for a while. This one was the first in the redesign and set the tone for our new color scheme and design elements — it features a gray background with white modules on top and a drop shadow, which is consistent with our account page on the website. They look pretty drastically different from the transactional emails we were sending before. Since these are newer, we’re still waiting to see the impact they have on the flow and what we can iterate on. I’ll follow up with you on that one.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>Cool. Well, yeah, I definitely like a more designed receipt-style email. Sometimes you just get a plain text “Thanks for your purchase,” but to me, it’s nicer when you get a well-designed email that brings everything together, makes you feel secure about your purchase, and gives you the information you need.</p><p><strong>Julia Papanek: </strong>That’s exactly it. Our previous comms were simpler — just a headline, some body copy, and the order details. So this one is a big improvement.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>Cool. And you said this one was focused on a specific product. Do you have separate emails for different products?</p><p><strong>Julia Papanek: </strong>Each product has its own brand identity, which is mostly reflected in the colors we use. You can see that the letters in “check” and “all the time” in the second module headline create this little gradient. For our mental health products, that gradient effect is part of the brand identity. I created it using a span style on each letter to create the overall gradient feel. Some of our other products, such as Hard Mints, feature a green color theme. We strive to be mindful of this when creating communications, ensuring they’re specific to the product the customer ordered.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>Cool. Yeah. Fancy. I didn’t even notice the gradient on live text — that’s a pretty fancy move. Nice one. Alright. Well, any other final thoughts? Maybe some advice you’d give to a new email marketer or someone looking to make emails like these?</p><p><strong>Julia Papanek: </strong>Yeah, I think the first step, like we talked about earlier, is moving away from full image-based emails. There are a lot of benefits to using live code if you can. So my first piece of advice would be to learn some HTML and CSS. From there, just be creative, test different ideas, and always keep learning.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>Yeah, and I think you mentioned you have a design system. These layouts seem pretty consistent.</p><p><strong>Julia Papanek: </strong>Yeah, we’ve gotten a lot more consistent with our design system this year. We used to design everything in code, so as we were coding, we were also designing at the same time. That was nice for speed, but it didn’t help much with scaling. So now we’ve moved our design process into Figma, and we have a component library — basically wireframes of all the different modules with the styling stripped out. We have spaces for images and copy, and all the character counts are defined. It makes creating a new email really easy. We just create the shell and pull in the modules we want. Our copywriters know exactly how many characters to use, and they can edit directly in Figma. Once it gets to me, I add the design elements, final touches, and make it feel really special. It’s created a lot more cross-channel communication.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>Nice. Yeah, I like that flow a lot. It feels like a very modern process compared to getting a PSD and having to cut out all the images. I think it’s great when designers and developers can collaborate like that — it makes the emails much better in the end.</p><p><strong>Julia Papanek: </strong>Yeah, and it was a lot of work and time to set up, but it has sped things up so much now that we have it in place. We also have HTML snippets associated with the Figma components, so once the design is ready, we grab the pre-coded wireframes of the HTML and start plugging in the design elements and copy.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>And lastly, I think you mentioned something about AI. Do you guys use AI in some of your emails?</p><p><strong>Julia Papanek: </strong>We use a little bit of AI to help us write some of the liquid logic. I’ve been working with one of our MarTech engineers on that. For example, if you scroll down to the order confirmation or order details module, that’s actually a content block so we don’t have to code it into each order confirmation. As I mentioned, there’s a different one for each brand. So as much as possible, we plug things into content blocks. If we need to make changes, we can edit one central space. That makes it much easier. However, sometimes we want to create more complex content with the blocks. For example, if we want to switch up the colors for different brands, we can create one template and then add liquid logic that assigns a color to the headline within the content block, rather than the template itself. So we have one template where we can swap out the headline color for each brand. We might use AI to help us create that content block shell since it’s a bit more complicated.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> Do you use Really Good Emails for other kinds of inspiration?</p><p><strong>Julia Papanek: </strong>Oh yeah. I have a reminder on my calendar every Monday to go on Really Good Emails and look for inspiration. And we have a Slack channel — I think it’s called “Email Inspo” or something like that — where I try to share one email from Really Good Emails each week so people can stay inspired and know what’s going on in the email world.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>Alright, thank you for joining us today.

What caught my eye about these emails in particular is the data, and it's actually the stuff that you don't see. The deal with Roundup emails is that your data must be accurate, and that's a lot of work to accomplish. That's a year in the making, quite literally, because you have to plan ahead and then accumulate that data as the year goes on.</p><p>Then you can have the data at the end of the year to show people and accurately wrap up the year. In terms of design, I love that they personalize it by placing the logo at the top of your avatar. That’s just a really nice and easy touch, and it’s easy enough to feed in as well. When you scroll in, you have things like this, very blocky play. I think design and great copy combined is just magic in email. Things like, “3,282 total watch hours. Fans can’t take their eyes off you.” That’s really nice. However, what really caught my eye was that they did the math on “you can drive from Las Vegas to Area 51 2,188 times.”</p><p>There’s a lot of decision-making and planning that has to be done there. I’d love to see what the fallback was if you didn’t have that many hours. Maybe if your hours were in the hundreds or the tens, did they use a different bit of data there? And the fact that they picked Las Vegas as the destination for Area 51... did someone say an alien party? I’d love to know what the decision-making was there as well. That’s really fun.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: I really like this. Even this is like their little rewind sort of thing to make it seem like this is your year in review. I like how they mix illustrations with personalization. They’re not just pulling in your image. I think that’s really smart to make it feel more integrated. And then, as you go through the email, they really highlight when they are using personal data by bolding what’s individual to you. That’s really smart to bring your eye to that section. Even here, again, mixing in illustrations, maybe even a background image, makes it feel more personal and not just thrown in there. I think they’re doing a great job with that.</p><p><strong>Najmah Salam</strong>: I think with Roundup emails, there’s definitely space for a bit of wackiness. Maybe there’s more area to play with the branding. If you have a fairly basic or strict branding that you stick to throughout the year, the Roundup is a great place to make it more fun, a little wacky, and go off-piste as well. We can see that here. I like the squiggles and the illustrative elements. I feel like we saw a lot of that at the time, and I still see it now. It’s a good way of making things look friendly, accessible, and approachable. The other thing I wanted to bring to your attention was the email poll at the bottom. I’m not sure about the utility of having up to five elements to choose from in a poll. Personally, I’ve always preferred just “thumbs up” or “thumbs down” because it gives me a quick read on how people feel.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: It is interesting to think about what each option means. Has an email ever really made me feel this happy? If you pick that option, what happens? Does it get forwarded to the person who sent this email? Or if you hit sad, does that mean the email might change in the future? I like people who include these in their emails. I don’t really click on them often, but I can see how this data might get lost when you’re just doing campaigns every day. Still, having some way to get feedback from your audience is a good step.</p><p><strong>Najmah Salam</strong>: I’m a big fan of having feedback in emails. Perhaps YouTube can afford to do this because it has the critical mass of people receiving these emails. The companies I’ve worked with had lists in the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands. For me, the best I could do was a simple sad or happy option, and if some people clicked, that was already useful. YouTube, with its massive subscriber base, can probably gather a lot more meaningful data. And honestly, I don’t think an email has ever made me that happy or that sad.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: It was also interesting to see the legal copy calling out that the statistics were calculated between a specific time period. That might help address data concerns, such as people inquiring about why YouTube has all this data or what timeline it covers. Including that detail helps reduce fear and shows the data is used to improve the experience rather than just spying.</p><p><strong>Najmah Salam</strong>: That’s a really good touch. It makes me think that some manual work was involved here. This isn’t just data automatically accumulated; there was a concerted effort to pull data from a specific time range and then craft an email around it. That shows intentionality.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Like you were saying, if the numbers are closer to zero, there’s also an opportunity. As much as it’s cool to see big numbers and share them with your followers, there’s just as much opportunity to provide resources to people with lower numbers or even zero, helping them get back into the product and produce more videos. It’s a good way to check in with your user base and see if they’re experiencing any issues. Alright, fast forward to 2020. They’ve retained some of the same elements but introduced additional data.</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/4217080465494d10a78a48942b483c56"">(<a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/really-good-emails-your-2020-year-in-review-is-here"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">See the full email</a>)</p><p><strong>Najmah Salam</strong>: I think there’s some maturity here in the design. Where we had a very blocky layout, this became much more scrollable. They made a real effort to avoid blockiness, using unusual shapes to break up sections so it doesn’t look like tables. I really like that. They’ve kept the scribbly illustrative look, which is cool, but they’ve used it more smartly, guiding your eyes through the email. From a design perspective, it’s leaps and bounds ahead of the 2019 model. The text has more space to breathe, which makes each bit of data more meaningful because it isn’t scrunched up.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: They added more information, but perhaps lost some of the quirky touches, such as the Vegas reference. It’s more polished now. I still appreciate how the personalization is seamlessly integrated into the design, rather than being overly prominent. They’re also using color to highlight personalized data, making it stand out from the rest of the copy. That’s smart.</p><p><strong>Najmah Salam</strong>: Having a stricter color palette can be really useful in email design because it helps guide the eye. One tip I always give is: if you zoom out on an email and the call to action or the key elements still stick out, then you know the design is working. I think that’s the case here, with the bright green against black highlighting those data points.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: I actually thought these were buttons because they look like them, but I think they’re just headlines. They’re not clickable.</p><p><strong>Najmah Salam</strong>: That’s one pet peeve of mine: non-buttons that look like buttons.</p><p>For sure. Another nice touch is the inclusion of a note of gratitude at the bottom. “You’ve taken the challenge of 2020 head-on and kept our spirits high. Thanks for being a constant inspiration.” I like that. Gratitude in Roundup emails is powerful. It acknowledges the subscriber’s role in the relationship.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: This is interesting because you’re making an email for such a huge audience. It’s not segmented. Maybe if you were in the top 5 percent of creators, you’d get something special. But mostly this is going to a massive audience, all receiving the same “year in review.” It’s an attempt to drive some traffic around a hashtag. Ultimately, YouTube is built on user-generated content. Without people uploading videos, they’d struggle. So yes, more ukulele videos for sure. Alright, so in 2021, here’s the fresh new hotness. So what do you think about this one?</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/b389a0a2c9a34487b4da7c6ac7f7f146"">(<a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/really-good-emails-your-2021-year-in-review-is-here"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">See the full email</a>)</p><p><strong>Najmah Salam</strong>: I mean, again, the design is completely different. They’ve kept the scrollable effect. In 2019, it looked like a table. Now it’s much more experiential, where you scroll down. I think this is interesting, considering how big the text is when compared to 2019 as well. It is definitely a mobile-first experience. I don’t know, but this is my hypothesis: I think they have specifically designed it so that you can screenshot it and share it on social media from your phone.</p><p>That is what it looks like to me. It looks like they have had that in mind. There are some really cool things here, but I think there are also some areas that could have been improved. It is not really clear to me that that was the most-watched video upfront. I know it's mentioned in the text, but it is not made clear. I think a caption stating, “Your most viewed video was…” would be helpful. Yes, it is a design hierarchy, right? You want to lead the eye a bit more in terms of pointing the finger, leading with a title that says “your most viewed video was…” and then showing the thing. Whereas it is now often an afterthought, it was once the caption.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Again, with this one, I like the lockup here and then going down. I think you are right. I probably check my analytics all the time, so I know this is the most viewed video. But like you are saying, maybe having a better way to tell you, or even make it more like a surprise, like “guess what your most viewed video is” and then it shows you the answer — could be kind of a fun thing to try.</p><p><strong>Najmah Salam</strong>: Yes, I am sure YouTube has a budget to create a personalized, almost GIF-like video. I am sure they have that budget in there. Perhaps there is something that reveals and says, “Haha, this is your most viewed video,” or something similar. I really like this idea of creating something to be shareable.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: I also like the idea of them seeing what data points they have been able to pull in. Okay, they know the watch time and views, but now they also know they could pull in someone’s YouTube thumbnail and make it feel even more personal in their YouTube channel title. I think that is cool. With this next section, I thought they did some interesting stuff, pulling in more country data and using emojis. I thought that was a fun thing to try.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Najmah Salam</strong>: There is something funny to me about “you are connecting with fans.” You might be like “there is something with fans” with copy — “hey there, international superstar.” There is something really fun that you can be.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Yes, that is cool. I like that. Yeah, you should. That is some good copywriting on the fly. That is good.</p><p><strong>Najmah Salam</strong>: And this one, I thought it was funny. I noticed they don’t show you your top comment, which makes me wonder. Some comments on YouTube can be quite negative, so I am curious if maybe they just decide, “Okay, this is how many comments you are going to get,” versus the top-upvoted comment or whatever. I love the idea of the team being like, “Maybe we can put in the most upvoted comment,” and then they tried it, and they were like, “Hmm, maybe not, no, maybe no.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Exactly. Scrolling down, they finally asked for that social share. I kind of thought, like you are saying, screenshotting is a great way to get people, but now that they are asking for this, maybe we should see what those graphics could look like and if people would actually click on them.</p><p><strong>Najmah Salam</strong>: This is the main thing. Email does not exist in a silo. I think a good email should lead somewhere else. Specifically with something like this, you are not asking somebody to purchase something. You are not asking somebody to… what is the call to action here? I believe the call to action here is to encourage people to share their experiences on YouTube. I think making it clear was a really smart idea for this year. Also, they must have been looking at the Spotify ones — the famous ones, right? Their roundups are so focused on shareability. I have to imagine that was part of the process here. Maybe they were thinking, “Let’s make sure the content is more shareable,” as opposed to what we had over the last two years.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: I kind of like them writing tweets for you in your sort of voice. That is kind of cool. I am not a person who usually clicks these buttons in emails, but, as you said, if there isn't really a CTA or anything, it is nice to have some sort of landing page or a social share to share with your audience. And then, right down here, I thought it was interesting that they are trying to get you to… maybe this is targeted at me. I didn't create many Shorts this year, so I am curious if this was included in every email or if this one is specifically because I haven't engaged much with that product.</p><p><strong>Najmah Salam</strong>:&nbsp;Yes, that is a good point. I feel like it was really new and something they had only just released at this time. This is probably a good opportunity for them to promote that product as much as possible and encourage people to create a Short. Here is the thing. A design cheat I love is when you have two overlapping things that break up a rectangular block. Those hands over the rectangle — that is so easy to do because you can achieve that with a transparent PNG. I like the way the shapes are broken up in this.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Even just making a stock image go over that line a little bit really helps you transition to different parts of the email. That is a smart one. This last little section has those lifetime highlights. I think that is cool to see. It is interesting that they make this all about your channel, rather than the community or anything else. I haven't really seen a year wrap-up of what other creators are doing. I think that it is smart for them to focus on the individual channel. Perhaps it feels more personal to you. For email marketers who want to create a year-end email, do you have any tips on how to gather data to make it effective?</p><p><strong>Najmah Salam</strong>: Yes, I think the planning really has to be about ensuring the data is tidy, because you want to be confident that the data you are pulling into these emails is as accurate as possible. What I suggest doing is… they kept it pretty simple in 2019. Maybe they had three major data points, and that was the whole email. So, if it is as simple as picking out three or four data points and then crafting a whole email about them, you can get clever with the copywriting like they did here. You can be clever about the design. The focus really needs to be on ensuring you have tidy data and then considering your fallbacks as well.</p><p>If someone does not have that data, consider what the email would look like in that case. If someone does not have that data available, should we not send an email at all? Do we switch up the copywriting? I think it should all be about quality over quantity. Do not be too concerned about having 15 different data points, because that can also get creepy, can’t it?</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Well, that is all I have for these emails. I heard you have a pretty awesome Etsy store where you can get some email swag.</p><p><strong>Najmah Salam</strong>: Yes, it is matchmetender.etsy.com, which I am sure will be in the show notes. It started with designing fun, little email-themed designs that I liked, because I am a designer. People started saying, “This should be a sticker,” so I started putting them up on Etsy, and emailers love them. I have mugs, stickers, t-shirts, and little sayings like “email’s not dead” and “this meeting could have been an email.” I fully endorse wearing them during particularly long and unproductive meetings.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Where can anyone else find you online? On Twitter? Is that a good place to find you?</p><p><strong>Najmah Salam</strong>:&nbsp;Yes, you can find me on Twitter. I am pretty chatty on Twitter when I am in the mood. I am pretty much all over the internet. I am a child of the internet, and I like to think as well. If you'd like to discuss email, marketing, or design, please don't hesitate to reach out.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Thank you again for joining this week.

Welcome back to another episode of Feedback Friday. This week, we're chatting with George from Inbox Army. He and his team build some of the most dialed-in email design systems I've seen. We're discussing Figma, accessibility, workflows, and more. There are many valuable takeaways on this one. Let's jump in.</p><p><strong>George Pettigrew</strong>: For those who don't know, my name is George Pettigrew. I'm a Creative Director at Inbox Army. Inbox Army is a full-service email marketing agency. I collaborate with developers, designers, copywriters, strategists, and other professionals to create effective solutions. I'm deep in the weeds and, yeah, just Creative Director. I oversee all aspects of creative direction. I've been in the design field for approximately 20 years. I've been in email design for roughly 12 years. I really cut my teeth in email design at my previous job. It was called <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/company/smiledirectclub/about/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">SmileDirectClub</a>. I was hired there as an entry-level production email designer. I didn't know anything about email design, and the only thing I knew about it was that I would give my designs to a developer, who would code them, and then they would look like crap. I knew very early on that there was a significant disconnect between design and development. That's how I ended up where I'm at now. I learned how to code emails. I learned how to code websites. I wanted to have that technical understanding of how everything works behind the scenes.</p><p>I believe the pivotal moment in my career was Litmus 2019. I tell everybody this because without it, I wouldn't be here. Matt, I'm not sure if you've heard of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/crystal-ledesma/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Crystal Ledesma</a>, but she's <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/company/zillow/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Zillow</a>'s lead engineer. I believe she gave a talk at Litmus in 2019 in San Francisco, focusing on design systems. That talk completely changed my life. I'm all about design systems. I'm all about Figma. I'm all about pixel perfection. I'll stop there. We'll get into it.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Perfect. Thanks for that background. So this first brand we're going to look at today is <a href=""https://linefriendssquare.us/?srsltid=AfmBOop7ckrJYofjU557EurZ8_SU5pdHGkZTgRp2LSRmXj7WFuaVr1NG"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Line Friends</a>.

href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/the-cutest-way-to-end-summer"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">See the full email here</a>)</p><p><strong>George Pettigrew</strong>: For one, I tell everybody that email is a form of UI design. So I start there. Think of an email design like a website or an app. Brands share certain elements, such as fonts, colors, and other visual aspects. Is it accessible? How do you make it accessible?</p><p>Everything starts with a style guide. You pull in that information from the client. You can visit their website, reverse-engineer it, or they will usually provide you with a style guide. Then I'll incorporate that information into a design system in Figma. That's what my team and I do, and then we are able to build email designs that are on brand every single time. The reason is that we're using the same fonts, the same UI elements, and similar elements. The name of the game is consistency. You want everything to look and feel like it's coming from your brand.</p><p>That's where design systems come into play. And yes, it all starts with UI elements, such as fonts, colors, buttons, and similar visual components. Every section of an email is a module, and the designers will take those modules, which are modular, meaning you can modify them. You can change things like image placement; for example, this hero has an image at the top. There's a different version that features an image at the bottom. They'll take the design system and framework, and orient them as needed. They'll then plug in all the necessary assets, and depending on the assets they have to use, that determines how we theme or design the email.</p><p>To elaborate a little on that, for instance, with this email, the top part of the email is the actual image, and the text is below. We wanted to give that full-image effect. So we took the bottom color of the image and bled it throughout the bottom of the email, actually, throughout the entire email. This is the actual image, and then this is the actual code. This is the image; everything else is controlled by code. What I do is think in systems, so everything I do is a system. For instance, when I space elements, I use what's called an eight-point soft spatial sizing system. This is industry best practice for countless reasons. That's where you space things in increments of eight.&nbsp;</p><p><img

I use type, I create type in systems. For instance, with headlines, I'll have H1 through H6, and in my body font sizes, I'll have body large, body medium, body small, and body extra small. Everything's a system. I start with the core elements that everything uses: text elements, spatial sizing systems, and grid systems. That's my framework. Once I have standardized the base elements in different subsystems, I combine them into a design system.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: So I guess: why is that important? Why can't I simply lay out the information and export it?</p><p><strong>George Pettigrew</strong>: The individual parts must work together to form a cohesive whole. There are so many reasons. Everything is connected. What's important to me with design is mitigating subjectivity. Throughout my career, I dealt with condescending creative directors and leaders. I've had some good leaders; I'm not generalizing all of them, but the majority of people I dealt with didn't know anything about email design or UI design. They just knew what they wanted. They didn't consider the user experience, which would frustrate me because everything they wanted was subjective.</p><p>To me, using things like grids and the eight-point soft spatial sizing system brings a basic mathematical approach into design that helps you be more objective. For me, it's about being more objective and not being subjective all the time. You want to be subjective sometimes, but knowing when to be subjective versus when to be objective is really important. The objectivity that systems and design systems bring to the table is undeniable. It's a no-brainer.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: I do feel that there are helpful resources when you start diving into why specific rules exist around typography, as they enhance legibility, or why elements are spaced a certain way, because they relate to each other in design. It's interesting to see an email in the wild and understand where it's breaking the rules or following them. It also helps inform your own design.</p><p><strong>George Pettigrew</strong>: And Matt, I can show you real quick for those who don't know what an eight-point soft spatial sizing system is. It's where you space elements in increments of eight. For instance, I have a button with dimensions of 16 pixels top and bottom, and 32 pixels left and right. The width of the button is relative to the text it contains. If I change the text, the width of the button changes, but the padding inside the button doesn't change. That's fixed. Understanding the difference between what's fixed and what's dynamic can help you understand how to code for specific situations.</p><p>If you look at the space below the headline, it's 32 pixels, a multiple of 8: 8, 16, 24, 32. The space between the headline and the paragraph is 16. Space to the left is 64. Space below is 48. I'm repeating the same spatial sizes every time. When you repeat patterns over and over, the eight-point soft spatial sizing system becomes the mathematical connective tissue that holds everything together. For type systems, this is a chart and a formula I devised. I have a formula I use to determine font size. For H1, H2, H3, and H4, this is the formula I use as a starting point. Sixteen is my base unit of measurement. A lot is based on 16. When you come up with a font size, that's cool, but how do you find the line height? For headlines, it's best practice to multiply the font size by 110%. That's where I start. I multiply the font size by 110%. Then you need to consider the x-height of the font. Every font has a different x-height. If I have two fonts at 40 pixels and one has a smaller x-height, the one with the smaller x-height will look smaller even at 40 pixels. Understanding the basics of x-height and typography helps you know that if the line height is too tight, I'll scale up to 120%, 125%, or 130%. Whenever I find the sweet spot, that line height becomes the variable I use to adjust. If it's 110%, I use 110% for all headline sizes, so there's a mathematical tie that connects them.</p><p>When developing type systems, it's challenging because a wealth of information is available.</p><p>People recommend using a one-ninth harmonious scale or other systems. What I found is that in email, you don't have much space, so you have to reduce the size. I try to use math as much as possible. For instance, if 40 pixels is my H1 and I'm doing 16 times 2.5 to find that, I start subjectively: with this font, how big can I make it? If it's 44 pixels, I start there. Then I take 44 and divide it by 16. But in this case, I have 40, so I say: okay, I came up with 40 subjectively, so now let me divide that by 16. Now I know that 16 times 2.5 is the formula that is used. If I were to come up with that through that formula, that's how I would do it. So, then I take that formula and think, 'Okay, if 2.5 is my multiple, or the number that I'm multiplying everything by, then I go down.' So I'm like, okay, what about 16 times 2.25? And then I create a scale. I keep going down. As you can see, I'm decreasing in 0.25 increments. So 2.5, 2.25, 2, 1.75. You'll see here I skipped, and this is where you create a system but then break it when you need to, because as fonts get smaller, sometimes you have to deviate. You have to change things. I might even have to change the line height because optically it looks too tight at that small size or something. You have to test a lot of this stuff, but I try to keep it as simple as possible, and I always start with these frameworks.</p><p>To your question about line height for headline versus body copy, you have to think about the nature of each. With headlines, they're going to be big, and you're not going to have many lines. You'll have three lines at most. But with paragraph copy, where the copy is way more dense, then you want to multiply by 1.5. So you raise the multiple. And 1.5 is the same thing as 150%. I just put 1.5 here, but it's equivalent to 150%. What's interesting about this is that it's best practice. For body font sizes, always multiply by 150% or 1.5, and then review the result. You need to consider the x-height. If it's too tight, then adjust it to 1.6, 1.55, or 1.7, as desired. However, use the same font for all, ensuring continuity in the spatial relationship between the font sizes. Does that make sense?</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: It is a lot of math, but as you said, taking the guesswork out makes things easier. Once you set it, there's no need to worry about how large this H1 will be, because we've already done the math. They set what it's going to be.</p><p><strong>George Pettigrew</strong>: Then every hero section starts with an H1. Every section starts with an H2. And if a headline is nested in a body section, it starts with H3. Sometimes you do have to break the sizes because it's not an ideal world every time. Copy will determine that a lot of the time. But that's the logic. You go up and down, create these systems, and use those systems.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: How do you build out these components? How do you decide which is important? How do you translate from desktop to mobile?</p><p><strong>George Pettigrew</strong>: I build everything based on the user. Before I begin writing an email, I consider the various users who will interact with the email I'm composing. I think of the client, relevant stakeholders, project managers, strategists, copywriters, designers, and developers. But the most important user is the customer receiving it. Figma is not the end result of your product. If you're building a UI product, which is what an email is, it’s not going to look exactly like what you QA in Figma. I start by understanding the different users. Then you also need to consider accessibility. You have people who use screen readers, those who prefer dark mode, and individuals who use cell phones. Once I've segmented all my different users, I consider the user experience for each one. <a href=""https://www.udemy.com/course/user-experience-design-fundamentals/?utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=udemyads&amp;utm_campaign=Search_DSA_Beta_Prof_la.EN_cc.ROW-English_Subs&amp;campaigntype=Search&amp;portfolio=ROW-English&amp;language=EN&amp;product=Subs&amp;test=&amp;audience=DSA&amp;topic=&amp;priority=Beta&amp;utm_content=deal4584&amp;utm_term=_._ag_185568238924_._ad_769543047750_._kw__._de_c_._dm__._pl__._ti_dsa-2436670174299_._li_9204014_._pd__._&amp;matchtype=&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22894903173&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADROdO0O5dZh6lMLUXXvNlMa7CukJ&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA55rJBhByEiwAFkY1QNphgGMc90tIziopsX7aOyF8LsFwgv-38SU5vaPNGXfQiwHBOn24uBoCQJAQAvD_BwE&amp;couponCode=CP251120G2#instructor-1"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Joe Natoli</a> is his name, I believe.

It teaches you how to build for your users.</p><p>With email, you have to understand the basics because it is a relatively archaic technology. It hasn’t evolved much since 1999. I start by identifying my users and designing with them in mind. I see this email as it is, but what will it look like in dark mode? I ask myself questions like: What will this email be like for someone using a screen reader? For someone who’s colorblind? I constantly think about all the different users, because as a brand, you won't know who the user is. The more accessible you make your designs, the higher your chances of engagement and brand awareness. You position yourself in a special place in people’s minds. When I interact with a product that is accessible or user-friendly, it shows me that whoever created it knew what they were doing. That's a big part of how I approach the design. To answer your question about going from desktop to mobile, I think about the user experience. What is it like for an email to be on a desktop versus a mobile? Many people say you need to design mobile-first, and I like that approach, but you still need to account for desktop users. You need to think about the experience for both platforms. The primary difference lies in how people interact with these elements. On a desktop, you're scrolling with a mouse. On mobile, you're scrolling with your thumb.</p><p>For instance, look at these buttons. This is the desktop button. The button hugs the text. But on mobile, the button spans the full width of the viewport. The reason is that people are scrolling with their thumb, and you don’t know if they're left-handed or right-handed, but you want it to be effortless and easy to click that button. You don’t want them to stretch their thumb over the screen. You want to keep it simple, and in my opinion, the best practice is to have the button span the full width of the viewport.</p><p><strong>Mat Helbig</strong>: How do you onboard someone onto a design system like this? Do you have to walk them through it? Do you present this to clients? How does this work for you?</p><p><strong>George Pettigrew</strong>: We present it to clients. Anyone who starts, I take a week to go through all of this: not just designing systems, but also identifying and understanding the different users, understanding the user experience, learning best practices for touch targets, and why you shouldn’t embed prominent elements into an image. Education is key. I educate everyone, from designers and developers to strategists, copywriters, and clients. It is very challenging to convince an image-based client to switch to a text-based approach, but every time we present this system to the client, they're completely on board because they understand the trade-offs between image-based and text-based solutions. They understand everything from dark mode to responsiveness.</p><p>Design is very abstract, but an email is not. It’s like a website. There’s a framework you use. So we explain the fundamentals of UXD when it comes to email, whether that's interacting on a phone, in dark mode, or on a desktop. We explain everything, and by the end of the call, they're blown away because they had no idea what they were getting into. Nobody explains this stuff. It’s ambiguous, and nobody wants to share information, which is ridiculous. We should share this information openly because people need to understand the fundamentals of user experience.</p><p>I tell clients all the time: most people are going to view your email out in the wild. They won't be connected to Wi-Fi. They’re going to have slow connections. If you have a full image-based email, it will take time to load, and nobody will wait. They'll click off before they even see anything. You've already lost the click-through at the moment of inception. By simply following best practices, you mitigate that. Something that simple increases your odds of increasing conversions and brand awareness.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: I suppose you did mention dark mode, and I'm curious: is that something you design within Figma, or is it something you troubleshoot with each HTML file? How does it work for your team?</p><p><strong>George Pettigrew</strong>: Yeah. We test everything in email on <a href=""https://www.litmus.com/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Litmus</a> to check how it looks. This is what I say about dark mode. In email design for dark mode, you want to understand the fundamentals, but, in my opinion, the benefits are not worth the effort, and I'll explain that in a second. When designing for dark mode, it's essential to note that any dark color controlled by HTML will convert or invert to a lighter color. You have different email clients that render emails differently in dark mode. A lot of them you cannot control. There are some clients where I could say, “Hey, I want to create a dark mode equivalent for this color,” and if you are doing a website and you have full creative control over how your site is going to look in dark mode, then in my opinion, the juice is worth the squeeze. You can take your colors, create a dark mode equivalent, and then use those. However, in email, the juice is just not worth the squeeze. Because if I say, “Hey, I want the email to look like this in light mode, but then like this in dark mode,” most email clients will ignore that.</p><p>My rule of thumb is to use lighter colors in light mode. In dark mode, they will automatically convert to darker colors. You do have some brands that use dark themes in light mode. I always tell them, “This email is going to look like a light theme in dark mode because your entire email is dark,” if it is not image-based. That is something to think about. People often struggle to design for dark mode, and I've read a book that everyone should have. It is called <a href=""https://www.refactoringui.com/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Refactoring UI</a> by the creators of Tailwind CSS. They show how to create these color scales. One problem I often encounter is that I meet with a client who has brand colors, but those colors do not inform me on how to design for accessibility. They are just the brand colors. And to be honest, most creative directors or most creatives on the brand side do not even think about accessibility, so they do not create solutions for it. The best solution, in my opinion, came from that book. They teach you how to take a primary color and create lighter and darker shades of that color. When designing in light mode, you use the lighter end of the spectrum. In dark mode, if you are designing for dark mode, you use the lighter end of the spectrum, because ideally, the backgrounds in dark mode are going to be dark or black. You need light colors to make it accessible. If you put dark colors on top of a dark background, it won't work. And vice versa in light mode: the backgrounds will be light, so you want to use darker colors on top of those light backgrounds to make them more accessible.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: That makes sense. That makes sense. Alright, so here are the actual coded emails pulled up, and I just wanted to highlight the really great use of live text in different places. It is really interesting to see how this content is laid out and, like you said, how it stacks on mobile, really thinking about those two different experiences. To me, it shows that people are actually thinking about these emails and looking, and as you said, everything honestly just feels really well-integrated into this system. It feels like there's enough space for everything. There is nothing that feels off.</p><p><strong>George Pettigrew</strong>: You will notice the hero image is a PNG. Technically, the background that appears below the image at the bottom is not part of the image. It is a PNG. It is cut out. We do this sometimes. It just depends on the overall email weight. I prefer not to use PNGs because they are almost always twice the size of JPEGs. But at the same time, if we can get away with it, we will do it. And you are seeing this as such, but some clients will take the darker blue color that we had behind it and completely convert it to a lighter blue or lighter orange color. Those are the kinds of things that you cannot control.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: I think it looks really good as a baseline. This is only one version of dark mode, but for the most part, I do feel like it is very mindful. Many sections still work really well, and I think leaning into live text also helps some of the content to work particularly well. Little tricks, as you said, such as using a PNG, help ensure that if the image is going to invert or change colors, there won't be a drastic change, making the email look good in both dark and light modes.</p><p><strong>George Pettigrew</strong>: Yeah, just making sure it is accessible in light mode. That blue color did not change in dark mode here, but it will change in dark mode in the one where the text turned white. Anyway, I just want to confirm that your design is accessible in light mode. If it is accessible in light mode, it will also be accessible in dark mode. That is the thing to keep in mind. And then just understanding what accessibility means. There are different types of accessibility, but the two main things are contrast and font size. Is there enough contrast between your font and the background? The easiest way to determine this is to use the WCAG accessibility tool and ensure that you have a contrast ratio of 4.5:1. You take the foreground color and the background color, enter them into the tool, and it will tell you. The other thing is the font size. I have heard mixed reviews, such as “It has to be 12 pixels and up to be accessible” or “It has to be 14 pixels and up to be accessible.” Our baseline font size is 14 pixels. Any disclaimer copy or similar content you see in one of our emails will be 14 pixels in size, and then the sizes increase from there. That is smaller than our paragraph copy.</p><p>As you consider it, there is a design construct, particularly in email, known as the hierarchical pyramid. We will take a look at the footer for a second, as it does a good job of displaying that. In email design, one key principle is that people scan. Two, with the hierarchical pyramid, a user can only process one thing at a time. One of my techniques that is highly effective in email, and which many people use without knowing why, is designing so that important information is visually advanced into the foreground and less important information is visually receded into the background. For example, in the footer, the copyright information, featuring the 2025 Line Friends line, is displayed in white text. Below that, we are using a light gray. Because white has more contrast than light gray, the white visually advances into the foreground, and the light gray visually recedes into the background. They are both still accessible. They both meet that 4.5 to 1 contrast ratio. However, thinking in terms of elevation is a very effective tool that you can use in email, as people tend to scan emails. You want to design your content so they see the important elements and scan right over the others, and you want that to be as seamless and frictionless as possible. One way to achieve this is through the use of color and contrast.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Yeah, really smart. I feel like some brands honestly would just make this all white. Or, some brands even make the unsubscribe option down here just black on black, so you might miss it. I have seen that. But this is really smart. It feels really cohesive. As you said, every section, why it stands out, and why you might push something to the background, makes sense, rather than just “I am going to make this all gray because it is the footer and no one is going to see it.” For those who scroll down, the information hierarchy, with separate colors, stand-out elements, or different formatting, and even adding space between sections, makes things easier to scan and more coherent as a design set.</p><p><strong>George Pettigrew</strong>: Yeah. But it is the same logic throughout.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: I feel like you are one of the first people I have talked to who thinks of themselves more like a UX designer than an email designer. People often focus on the visual side, copywriting, and other aspects, but building these systems and explaining things effectively is really interesting. Do you feel like you are more of an email designer? Would you say you are more like software? Where would you say your title is?</p><p><strong>George Pettigrew</strong>: I sit in the middle, and this is what I encourage every creative to do: sit in the middle, be that fulcrum between design and development. My goal, I used to tell people all the time, is to have an inch-deep, mile-wide understanding of how it all works so that if a developer tells me, “That is not possible,” I could do it for them and bring my solutions to life. I definitely sit in the middle, and I encourage any designer and anyone in UI: you have to sit in the middle. You have to be able to think like a designer and also like an engineer. They are complete polar opposites of the brain. You have a left side and a right side. Being able to do both, in my opinion, really makes you, I will not say indispensable, but it makes you highly sought after in this industry.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Awesome. Thank you so much for taking the time today to review some of these emails. I learned a lot, and I am excited to dive into Figma, learn more about these design systems, and hopefully create some visually appealing emails. Have a good one.</p><p><strong>George Pettigrew</strong>: Alright. Thank you for having me.</p>",mtthlbg,mtthlbg,,,"Thu, 27 Nov 2025 23:00:00 GMT"

Happy Friday.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> Friday, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/whale/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Matthew Smith</a>. How’s it going, dude?</p><p><strong>Matthew Smith:</strong> It’s going well. Sunshine here in Greenville, South Carolina. Well, I wanted to show you an email from the <a href=""https://www.elysiumhealth.com/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Elysium</a> group today. I don’t recall how I initially got on their list, but I’ve been impressed with their dedication to maintaining brand consistency in their emails. That takes a lot of work and shows a certain attitude or commitment to the craft.</p><p>So let’s check them out. I’m pretty impressed with the way these folks have been working, and I thought I’d walk you through it today. This is one of their newsletters. There are more Elysium emails on the Really Good Emails site. This one’s from May 19. They present the date and time upfront.</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/58cc7cd2a4d74844ac5c8c23b6f43bb9""></p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Do you like that, or would you rather they lead with a title?</p><p><strong>Matthew Smith:</strong> I was thinking about that. I feel like the date is probably less useful for the reader than a strong title. That said, different audiences respond differently, so you’d want to test it. For me, that section of an email should communicate what’s below — what’s happening, what it’s about — and this one doesn’t really do that. Now, we’re not seeing the subject line or preheader in this video, so maybe they reference it meaningfully there. But yes, I think a title would be more helpful. Overall, though, I really like the layout. They lead with imagery that feels scientific and interesting. The typography is outstanding — clean, simple, yet elegant — which perfectly suits their brand.</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/01a4f3b0089b48229687d249a21cb381""></p><p>As we move down, they begin with centered copy, featuring simple language and a clear focus. Then they switch to left-aligned text, and they have enough space between sections to make that work. It can be tricky to transition from a centered image to left-aligned copy, so be aware of this when creating emails. On mobile, it works better because the column feels cohesive, but on desktop, your eye moves from center to left, which can feel a bit unbalanced. Still, it works fairly well here. They also include this vertical line running down the center of the email — a nice design choice that creates a sense of a visual timeline. The illustrations have great texture and draw you in. You can read enough of each article to get hooked, and then click to learn more. If that last article is the featured one, it’s nice how they follow it with two additional thumbnail-style stories. In the mobile version, the text is slightly different, but the imagery stays large, which keeps the experience engaging.</p><p>I like their CTA — “Read the Story” — and how it leads you into the content. I can also go dig into <em>Science 101</em> if I want to read more about that. Then they do something fantastic: they curate a list of ten books. That’s such a smart way to provide content that’s not their own but is interesting and relevant to their audience. Finally, they move into their products. They lead with intelligence, curiosity, and educational content before the product section — a fascinating way to structure a newsletter. All of this is live text, which is great. I’m really impressed and encouraged by that. They conclude with a “Quote of the Month,” which is another fantastic content idea. It doesn’t have to be from your CEO — though in this case it is — but could come from anywhere.</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/dbfcdfcc89034f70943c2615b5397d95""></p><p>Someone who subscribes to this email is seeking reliable information to enhance their scientific understanding, while also gaining access to products if they’re an Elysium customer or prospect. I think that’s really smart. The footer is extremely simple, featuring only the essentials and social links. It’s a little odd that they double up on components — it seems like they’re repeating one. If it were me, I’d make that section feel different and move it higher up so the repetition isn’t back-to-back. Overall, they’ve done such a great job with typography — the foundation of good design — and I think they’ve nailed it. It’s a longer-form newsletter, but it works. I’m curious what you think.</p><p><strong>Matt Matthew Smithg:</strong> Yeah, that vertical line running through the whole email really elevates the template. Outside of the typography, it’s a pretty basic newsletter concept, but this version feels made for mobile consumption. I almost prefer the mobile experience. For some reason, on the desktop, the contrast feels lower and a bit harder to read.</p><p><strong>Matthew Smith</strong>: I think that’s because of the text weight. It appears they’re using a light or book weight, which can be difficult to read unless the text is large. It creates a little “buzzing” effect in your eyes. On mobile, the text is slightly bigger, which helps. If it were me, I’d consider switching from the lightweight to a regular weight for readability. I know that can be a tough brand decision, but readability should always win.</p><p><strong>Matthew Smith</strong>g: Even in this section, I like how they break up the paragraphs. If it were one big block of text, I wouldn’t want to read it. Adding those small spacers between paragraphs makes it much more digestible. Everything looks great overall. If anything, they could add some progressive enhancements — such as hover effects on links or buttons — so it’s clear what’s clickable. The “Read the Story” text is a bit light, so a rollover or opacity change could help enhance its visibility.</p><p><strong>Matthew Smith</strong>: For sure. I really like this upsell module too. Back when I worked in prospect email marketing, people always wanted newsletters like this — informative content first, followed by an upsell. That format converts well because you’ve already provided value before introducing a product. More newsletters could take this approach: stay on brand, feature interviews or related articles, and then include a gentle upsell. It’s a smooth flow — content first, product later.</p><p><strong>Matthew Smithg:</strong> Right, and finishing with that quote keeps it from feeling like you’re just being sold to.</p><p><strong>Matthew Smith</strong>: Exactly. These content modules are suitable for almost any business, particularly e-commerce. The reason someone “hires” this email with their time is that they get real value from it — insights, ideas, and useful information. For example, I can learn about Dr. Carrie Sims and her work on anti-aging, read related articles, explore curated book recommendations, and then see a relevant product. That’s a healthy structure for growing and serving your audience. So, great email all around. Just a few small improvements that could make it even better — but isn’t that true for all of us? Good job, Elysium. Thanks for getting in touch and sending this our way. Have a fantastic weekend. See you, email geeks out there.</p><p>Thanks for showing up. Have a good one.</p>",mtthlbg,mtthlbg,,,"Mon, 10 Nov 2025 23:00:00 GMT"

My name is Alice Lee and I’m the Principle Email Engineer over at Litmus. I just started in December and I’ve been coding almost every email since. Before that I was at <a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/tag/shutterstock/"" target=""_blank"">Shutterstock</a> and then before that Oracle Responsys and then before that was Epsilon. So I’ve been in the email game for quite some time. Since 2007.</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>I think you are the OG email person. So you actually gave me a few emails to look at this week and I’m really excited to go through them with you.</p><p><strong>Alice: </strong>Awesome.</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>Can you tell me a little bit about this <a href=""https://litmus.com/builder/306cc01"" target=""_blank"">first one</a>?</p><p><a href=""https://litmus.com/builder/306cc01"" target=""_blank""><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*opWJfMAM56VuLhRz.png""></a></p><p><strong>Alice: </strong>This was created back in 2015, so if you are looking at it and you’re like “Oh no… It’s white text on top of a photograph. That’s something not to do.” That would explain why. It is like 4 years old. This is based on the first ever kinetic interactive emails that I coded for Oracle. Which was for the <a href=""https://litmus.com/builder/ae60a89"" target=""_blank"">Lego Bionicle email</a> back in the day.</p><p>It’s based on old school hover interactivity (using hovers that activate sibling selectors in CSS). So this is not quite checkbox yet. I like to look at it in terms of beta interactive email. There is definitely room for improvement. You can see we have to have a call out: “Tap buttons to see what happens!”. Just to tell people, “Hey! You can actually interact with this email. It’s not a click-through. It’s a carousel.”</p><p><a href=""https://litmus.com/builder/306cc01"" target=""_blank""><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*B-4d6KPDB7lbO7uB.gif""></a></p><p>And it is mobile responsive. So if you hover over you can see all the different slides going past. It is a background image with CSS-animated transparent PNGs that float on top.</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>Ooooh aaaahh fanncccyyyy</p><p><strong>Alice: </strong>The reason we did that instead of animated PNGs is because animated PNGs aren’t very well supported (still). Animated GIFs don’t support translucency, so you end up with jagged edges. So this was the best way that I was able to come up with to retain the background image and have animation.</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>So how does this sorta process work? Does Shutterstock come to you and say, “Hey we want and interactive email.”?</p><p><strong>Alice: </strong>When they hired me they knew I was all about interactivity. I showed the Lego Bionicle email during my interview. As soon as I got hired I was like, “Let’s go on this! We should do it!”. Finally they found a good excuse for me to do it.</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>So were there any unique challenges for this one? Outside of what you covered?</p><p><strong>Alice: </strong>Just the amount of code time involved really and all the testing to make sure it worked. And actually the interactive code that I tested first on Lego postion:absolute stopped working on Android between then and this email so I had to refactor all of the dimensions and all the positioning to work with postion:relative instead.</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>Does this have a fallback on different email clients then?</p><p><strong>Alice: </strong>Yeah absolutely it does. It works on a similar fallback principle to what I will be presenting next. Which is just a normal animated GIF layout.</p><p><a href=""https://litmus.com/builder/306cc01"" target=""_blank""><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*GLfWkKyWGZMaucx_.png""></a></p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>That’s actually a good transition to the next email. Is this another Shutterstock one?</p><p><strong>Alice: </strong>This is for <a href=""https://litmus.com/builder/41b2807"" target=""_blank"">Offset</a>, which is Shutterstock’s more premium brand. This does use a punched card carousel technique to control the slides forward and backward. You can click on either of the arrows. Which are animated with CSS or if you can click on the little rectangle above to activate the carousel.</p><p><a href=""https://litmus.com/builder/41b2807"" target=""_blank""><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*9oKhy-t9W8zG-I1H.png""></a></p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>Does this go by itself at all? Is that a possibility in email?</p><p><strong>Alice: </strong>You could add a CSS animation to it, but it wouldn’t be as well supported. That is why we only use CSS animations sparingly on the arrows.</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>I notice that we’ve seen a lot of hover effects. Should we all just be adding hover effects to our buttons? Or when is it not a good choice to do animations?</p><p><a href=""https://litmus.com/builder/41b2807"" target=""_blank""><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*PuixVdwCY-DYXOva.gif""></a></p><p><strong>Alice:</strong> I say yes. I am biased, but hover effects have a pretty good fallback. If it doesn’t hover it doesn’t break the entire email. Also hover effects are becoming integral for accessibility reasons. If you want your audience to interact with your email then a lot of times hover over a link and there’s no over effect the only thing that’s changing on the screen is your mouse cursor and often times it’s so subtle that you can’t tell. So I would definitely recommend adding hover effects just to make sure everyone knows where and when to click through.</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>I did notice this is white text on an image once again. 😀</p><p>What does the fallback on this one look like?</p><p><a href=""https://litmus.com/builder/41b2807"" target=""_blank""><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*m8jpegtwKQ5dtzyL.png""></a></p><p><strong>Alice: </strong>So this is the fallback that is in the HTML body by default. This one uses an external stylesheet to pull in all the interactive CSS. The reason for that is because usually there is a lot of overlap between whatever supports external CSS and whatever supports interactive CSS. So it’s just a way that I like to keep my code pretty clean.</p><p>Also sometimes if you have your interactive CSS in the embedded &lt;style&gt; tag it may conflict with any progressive enhancements. We don’t want to deal with that.</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>What is business ask for this one? Why would you use a carousel for this? Is there a specific value add that you wanted to communicate?</p><p><strong>Alice: </strong>Shutterstock really wants to put a lot of focus on its stock imagery. We were always looking for better ways to display our product.</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>Now that you are at Litmus, we can look at your own emails. So is <a href=""https://litmus.com/builder/958580b"" target=""_blank"">this one</a> that you coded as well?</p><p><a href=""https://litmus.com/builder/958580b"" target=""_blank""><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*T4DrWCgIPDunIVc0.png""></a></p><p><strong>Alice: </strong>Well this is based on code that already existed that <a href=""https://twitter.com/KevinMandeville"" target=""_blank"">Kevin Mandeville</a> came up with, but I ended up refactoring it because this newsletter was originally done in table-less style.</p><p>This is another way that we learn from our practices and see what doesn’t work. Unfortunately table-less emails don’t necessarily work that well if you are trying to sustain it as a developer. What was going on in this table-less was that there’s still ghost tables in the email for Outlook so whenever you wanted to make updates, you had to update it both in the &lt;div&gt; and the ghost table. So in that sense is it really table-less? Is it really that sustainable?</p><p>The answer we came to is that eventually not really. So I refactored it to do away with that and try to have minimal tables but also retain a lot of those semantic HTML tags involved (like &lt;h&gt; tags).</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>This top section is definitely the standout part of the email for me. This rollover effect to the video. How difficult is it for something like this to be implemented?</p><p><a href=""https://litmus.com/builder/958580b"" target=""_blank""><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*FdXuXzy-UlEc5oHF.gif""></a></p><p><strong>Alice: </strong>Not very difficult at all. This is just a hover effect that turns the opacity for the cover image from 100% to 0%. And it reveals the animated GIF as background image behind it.</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>I know that we talked before that there may be a few different ways to do this. Why is this the way that you chose?</p><p><strong>Alice: </strong>I explored doing display:none instead of opacity:0 or visibly:hidden instead but the problem with those is that it reduced the image completely from the document flow. So if your mouse hovers over it just rapidly flickers on and off because it’s being removed and then coming back. You don’t want to deal with that jittery hover.</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>This transition is very smooth. I imagine the fallback for this is that the hover effect just doesn’t work. Right?</p><p><strong>Alice: </strong>Yea. Then you can just click through and see where it goes.</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>I love that effect. It seems like an easy way to really spice up the email and get people to click on that section. So what would be the support for something like this?</p><p><strong>Alice: </strong>This is actually pretty well supported across <a href=""https://emailclientmarketshare.com/"" target=""_blank"">most email clients</a> including Apple Mail and Gmail. Those are our two most popular.</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>Now we can judge some other people’s emails. We put you in the hot seat for the first few. We have some brands that we really like. I’m a big fan of <a href=""https://litmus.com/builder/6da6066"" target=""_blank"">this one</a>. I’m always scared to use gradients in email.</p><p><a href=""https://litmus.com/builder/6da6066"" target=""_blank""><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*YglToKoCKT7V1_yn.png""></a></p><p><strong>Alice:</strong> What I loved about this is that it is a CSS linear gradient background and it’s combined with these CSS box-shadows and when they are both not supported it falls back to this flat dark-blue background. I feel like the top dark blue background compensates for the lack of the drop shadow. It gets lighter later on. It really doesn’t detract from the experience that much.</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>We where playing around with <a href=""https://litmus.com/email-builder"" target=""_blank"">Litmus Builder</a> earlier and there are a bunch of different views. For example, you can turn off images and see how the email will look. As you can see here, this is a good example of how important live text is. This email is still pretty readable. I can get all the information from it. I can still see CTAs.</p><p><a href=""https://litmus.com/builder/6da6066"" target=""_blank""><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*axtZQTjfWAP9NbOB.png""></a></p><p><strong>Alice:</strong>&nbsp;…and those CTAs have a great hover effect with a slight transition. Inverting the background and text colors is an easy way to help retain the contrast ratio.</p><p><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*qyxbJwMh1mcFwR4D5VbBjQ.gif""></p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>I’m a big fan of what they do. Every time I get one of their emails I’m excited to see what they’ve done.</p><p><strong>Alice: </strong>Let’s take a look on mobile.</p><p><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*H_nmmtKR8_ri8exEzOwhXA.png""></p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>I’m really into brands that take time to style that mobile stylesheet. Really think about how it is going to look. When a desktop email is laid out in a PSD the mobile optimization part might be the last part. Spending a bit more time on that really makes it stand out.</p><p><strong>Alice:</strong> This is kinda weird, but I really like the fact that horizontal line at the top of the email goes from being on the side margin to being full size on mobile. Something like that is just really special to me. When the email resizes to mobile, the side margins disappear to give more horizontal real estate.</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>Are these web-fonts?</p><p><strong>Alice: </strong>Yea! They are a custom web font “<a href=""https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato"" target=""_blank"">Lato</a>” via @import.</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>I’m assuming just a fallback to a web-safe font.</p><p>One of my favorites is <a href=""https://litmus.com/builder/1de7208"" target=""_blank"">this one</a> from <a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/tag/invision/"" target=""_blank"">Invision</a>. We’ve actually talked about them before on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAmmIJM8FaA&amp;list=PLzxszDYZCMQ3mVUDYR8L_T1hH4xOyfIi-"" target=""_blank"">Feedback Friday</a>. You showed me this and I really got into this animation right here.</p><p><a href=""https://litmus.com/builder/1de7208"" target=""_blank""><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*07AJ5trzcFk6qXABa0fWUA.png""></a></p><p><strong>Alice: </strong>OMG. I love that. When you hover over the entire module changes. I took this apart the other night so all images are wrapped in a SPAN, and all of that is wrapped in an A tag with a hover effect. Activating the hover on the A tag causes the SPAN tag to use a CSS transition to change the background position of a transparent PNG corner image from being behind the image to being display:block on top of the image. The position pulls it from the bottom corner into the image to reproduce this page-curling look.</p><p><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*oLUH8hqa7ZSU0JoRmQ8ceQ.gif""></p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>I am impressed.</p><p><strong>Alice: </strong>Only negative — I wish the hover effect on the link list below was more obvious and less subtle. It just makes it a bit darker. For people who have challenges with vision — like myself even — it’s hard to tell when you’ve actually hovered over or tabbed over one of those text links. Even doing something like removing the underline on hover would help a lot.</p><p><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*zcb3JFYjE1tz-pn4dDrn7Q.gif""></p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>So this is done with a CSS animation right?</p><p><strong>Alice: </strong>No. It’s actually a CSS transition. There is a difference. Transition is more supported across more email clients.</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>This also looks like a custom web-font.</p><p><strong>Alice: </strong>Yea. This one is “<a href=""https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins"" target=""_blank"">Poppins</a>”, pulled in with an external stylesheet straight from the Google Fonts API.</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>This is just a newsletter. It is impressive to me that they take the time to do this sort of stuff. Investing in templates like this and reusing them with different content is really fantastic.</p><p><strong>Alice: </strong>Absolutely. I’m subscribed to this newsletter and every time they send it out, I’m like “Ohh! They are doing three columns this time instead of two columns.” Just subtle changes they make really impress me.</p><p><strong>Matt:</strong> We have a few more to look at. <a href=""https://litmus.com/builder/214ef7a"" target=""_blank"">This one</a> has a really fantastic GIF.</p><p><a href=""https://litmus.com/builder/214ef7a"" target=""_blank""><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*qTSAWM5b8Pm4pJQUAUpQVA.png""></a></p><p><strong>Alice: </strong>This one I really like. This is a digital marketing agency in the Netherlands. They seem to be really proud of their newsletters to the point that they actually put it on the front page of their website.</p><p>Scroll all the way to the bottom and read all their newsletters. They all fit into this same format so you can tell that it’s part of the same series.</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>It’s a long one.</p><p><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*z-dRPQcRva5HVzFIKoYojA.png""></p><p><strong>Alice:</strong> It’s pretty long. These templates by DPDK serve as this really well-designed container for all the different themes they do. This one is promoting a glitch themed newsletter. It’s very glitchy. In a good way.</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>This big button GIF trend really stood out to me when I first opened this. What do you think of that?</p><p><strong>Alice: </strong>It’s like a love hate thing. I hate it that it is mostly images, but I also love that it is animated. It is unfortunate. If I were to do this, I would try to put at least some live system text on top of a live animated background GIF.</p><p>I suppose that GIFs are the way that works for their newsletter. I like the fact that the largeness and the boldness of the animation makes it stand out in a unique way from all the other competing graphical elements.</p><p><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*kcxC_irhjfQOc3Gi3I0QRw.gif""></p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>This use of images may be to support layouts that could be difficult to code in email. I understand in order to do these types of layouts relying on images is an option. I do like that the content doesn’t really seem repetitive. When scrolling down the email each section stands out. That flow GIF grabs your attention right away when you open the email. It totally pulls me in.</p><p><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*gXW6zC0xK05zHkMj0d0eTg.gif""></p><p>We have one more from them too.</p><p><strong>Alice: </strong><a href=""https://litmus.com/builder/776fc7c"" target=""_blank"">This is</a> just another example how they are using the similar newsletter layout with a completely different theme. This incorporates a lot of the themes that <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d3fQVSDO6tkTBxx9LDFpvYFO72gj8XbN/view?usp=sharing"" target=""_blank"">Meghan from Emma</a> spoke about in her session. The illustrative style as well as the diagonals to bring your eye down.</p><p><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Xw6z2gU_BTqkC4eOWjRLwg.png""></p><p>The animated GIF is awesome, and it looks so smooth because the very graphic look of this with solid colors instead of gradients and shadows means that each color is encoded smoothly into the GIF format.</p><p><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*uzakNmleKF-03IruEDhPEQ.gif""></p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>So when you are designing emails at Litmus now what kind of new ideas are trying to bring in? Are you getting your inspiration from different emails you see? How are you coming up with new things?</p><p><strong>Alice: </strong>Absolutely. We just hired an email designer that is fantastic, <a href=""https://litmus.com/blog/author/lily"" target=""_blank"">Lily Worth</a>. She wrote a great blog post about the rise of <a href=""https://litmus.com/blog/trending-in-email-design-custom-illustrations"" target=""_blank"">illustrations in email</a>. She’s pretty passionate about and she’s going to try to incorporate more of that as well.</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>We did mention that a few of these are mostly images. How important is accessibility when you are designing these emails?</p><p><strong>Alice: </strong>We are also trying to put more focus on accessibility. Of course because some of these examples are mostly imagery, it’s not super accessibility friendly. Another great thing that we’ll be doing, is that we are really trying to make sure and test every background color and text color combo to make sure it’s AA certified.</p><p>I’ll be refactoring all of our old emails to be more accessibility friendly. Checking for missing ALT tags, making sure that tables have role=“presentation” on them. There is like a whole checklist that I go through.</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>What really interests me was when you talked about that original <a href=""https://litmus.com/builder/ae60a89"" target=""_blank"">Lego Bionicle email</a>. What drove you to even try to make that happen? What motivated you? Why do you keep trying new things with interactive email?</p><p><img src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*DKnDsUGoagRKSvLEWhHkuQ.png""></p><p><strong>Alice:</strong> Our client at the time, Lego, was relaunching their Bionicle brand. They really wanted to display something truly innovative in their email. We had just started experimenting with interactive CSS for B&amp;H. The problem with that email is that their CSS wasn’t super reusable or templatable. So I did a new version of that where we could re-use it, insert new images and try new layouts with it.</p><p><strong>Matt:</strong> Is there anything coming up next that you are really interested in? Do you believe the hype around the whole <a href=""https://developers.google.com/gmail/ampemail/"" target=""_blank"">AMP</a> thing?</p><p><strong>Alice:</strong> It sounds like a lot of people are in the wait and see boat. While I am really excited to try it out, it’s difficult to find ways to actually send it out right now.</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>Any other CSS or email client support things that you think will come soon?</p><p><strong>Alice:</strong> I do think that we are making strides with accessibility specifically. So the more people adopt that, there can be new sources available for that.</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>Last question. So all this stuff looks great, but how do I tell my boss that I want to make and email like this? How do you get buy-in to try interactive email?</p><p><strong>Alice: </strong>Interactive email has performed well for the clients that I’ve worked with before. Your milage may vary, but for the emails that I’ve produced we’ve seen at least a 10% increase in click-through-rate (CTR) and a 11% ROI. For Offset when we introduced interactivity our first time conversions where 123% increase. That’s pretty good. I could take those numbers and told my boss, “Hey look! We had this success with it before. Why not try redo it?”.</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>That’s about it!

Get to know your customers to understand their objections, and squash those objections. Tell customers what to buy with your email because they like to be led and informed.</p><p>2. Limit your palette of typography and color so it doesn't get in the way of the content. What do you want customers to walk away feeling? Take that content and turn it into an experience for customers.</p><p>3. Embracing UGC (user-generated content) can be uncommon in a good way. Showcase a nice picture that feels authentic and represents the brand. Advertise a well-lit video that feels natural, such as filming on a phone. Make the content look native to the platform you’re publishing it on and make it look authentic to your customers.</p><p>BONUS: Keep press efforts in your campaigns. Use enticing headlines, strong sentences, and call out customer quotes in the creative.</p><hr><p><strong>Matthew Smith: </strong>Happy Friday, email geeks. I am here with Meredith Schoenberger and Ben Philabaum from <a href=""https://biddyco.com/"" target=""_blank"">Biddyco.com</a>. I love these folks. I've gotten to know them over the last, I guess maybe it's been like two months, three months, something like that. You know, it's like a COVID romance we've got gone on or something like that. Cause it's about the same amount of time.&nbsp;</p><p>I found you yall through an ad. So I know that the work you do as digital advertising is working and I've just really enjoyed getting to know you all and what you're doing. And so when I asked if we could talk about the relationship between email and advertising, we all jumped on it. So welcome to feedback Friday, where we're going to talk about email and advertising today. I'm grateful to have you here.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ben Philabaum: </strong>Thank you for having us. It's an honor to be here. Been followers and admirers of Really Good Emails for years, years for sure. So very cool to be here with you.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matthew Smith: </strong>Did we agree on the amount that I was going to pay you to say that I can't remember if we talked about that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ben Philabaum: </strong>It&nbsp;was&nbsp;a lot.</p><p><strong>Matthew Smith: </strong>Oh yeah. Okay. Well, let's add a comma. That's awesome. Well, I appreciate it. Well, yeah, it's super fun to have you all here. And I would love to dive right in and we'll use this email and advertising set up between these two emails and two ads as a way of getting also to know Biddyco a little bit. So why don't we start here with this <a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/supergoop/"" target=""_blank"">Supergoop!</a> sunscreen myth-busting email.</p><p>Tell me a little bit about what you think is working effectively and then intermittently, just let me know when you want to jump over to the ad and we'll walk through that as well.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/6f9b29b5a7dd44dfa9ac157e15700623""></p><p><strong>Meredith Schoenberger: </strong>Yeah.&nbsp;So Supergoop! It is one of my favorite brands. Just a quick backstory, they are a very innovative DTC brand that has kind of melded sunscreen and skincare. And so one of the big things that we always talk with our work is how do we get people to push over the edge? How do we get someone to click, to buy, whatever? And usually, we will turn to pain points or objections that our future potential customers have.</p><p>And how can we squash those super quick? And so we thought that this email was just such a great living, breathing example of how to squash objections super quick. So you see, you know, they. Take three of kind of the most popular ones. And then not only do they tell you why it's not true, but they then suggest a product.</p><p>So it's showcasing their product catalog. It helps tell customers what to buy. We always say that like, don't assume that your customer knows what to do or knows what to pick. They like to be led. So I thought it was a really beautiful way of kind of making it really content-based, informative, but also very suggestive.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ben Philabaum: </strong>I think as far as just the objection busting, and that's kind of our main focus, especially on the ad side, it's more so like retargeting, you know, someone's been to your site, you know, 97% of them aren't going to buy. Why not? Most likely they had some hesitation. They had some concern, some question on their mind that wasn't answered.&nbsp;</p><p>So yeah, this whole email, I think just as a great job of not just hitting just one objection, but multiple.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matthew Smith: </strong>Yeah, it's such an interesting framework. I love this way that they go from, you know, myth busted, shop it. Myth busted, shop it. Myth busted shop it. You know, like what a cool style of dealing with that challenge.</p><p>It's even, product, myth busted, shop it. Product, myth busted, shop it, and you know, some nice overlays, some things that are working well. One of the things from a design perspective that I think is, is so effective is in this myth-busting work that they're doing, or a, I think objection, busting, which I appreciate the way you said that is they're using a very limited palette of typography and color, so that doesn't get in the way of the content.&nbsp;</p><p>So often people have emails that are too busy. I've never seen an email that's too simple. I just haven't, you know, it's doesn't exist. I mean, maybe somebody said, you know, hello, and that was it. And like, that's the end? Hello world. too simple. No CTA. I hope it works.</p><p>Yeah, I haven't seen it. Maybe Really Good Emails should try one, but in the meantime, you know, being able to use this yellow and call out these headings, just a fantastic, fantastic job of really highlighting, literally highlighting. Myth busted, you know, and, and this highlighter style of heading. The only thing that is a little weird to me, and I guarantee you that 99% of people don't see it and don't even pay attention is it's a little weird to me that you have a typography here that is this really elegant stuff that fits well with the brand and then under busted, it's different. type style, but the same size.&nbsp;</p><p>So generally speaking as a design best practice do not do this. Do not take very, very similar visual aesthetics here with only one difference of, you know, like it's serif and sans-serif. Instead, what they could have done would be to have a smaller typeface here and then utilize that with maybe gray.</p><p>Maybe make the text just a little lighter, like create a little more different. So it's a little bit like, question, answer, or keep it the same. You know, just let it be the same and it would have worked probably just fine. So I think that's the only thing that I can think of that isn't working. Ok, two other things.</p><p>Okay. I have to live up to my picky asshole behavior here. So one of the things that I would love to see in these emails, and we can jump over to the next one here in a minute. But is one is especially in a simple email like this, it would be great to see some interactivity on a button. Yeah. And that's doable these days and it's easy to degrade down for older email clients like Outlook.</p><p>And it's so much more effective to help people feel like they know what to click now that said the buttons are very obvious. And I like it, you know, they connect. Right. But. The other issue that ties in with this is these two emails that we're going to look at. If they had sent this off to, Mail Bakery or to <a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/uplers/"" target=""_blank"">Uplers</a>, or some of the high-quality developers out there, they could have had this developed in a way that then they can multivariate test with different type.</p><p>They can have it flex for mobile a lot more smoothly, you know, and look at some different opportunities here. So the text is okay and it works, you know, like at least on the mobile I can view it it's big enough, but live text is the future. And I haven't looked at the alt-text on this. But generally speaking, people don't take the time to really deliver high-quality alt text on, you know, an element like this.</p><p>And I think that's problematic. So I always talk about live text being something we'd like to see more of, but everything else in this email is working effectively. One thing I think. Would be interesting. And you all probably know a little bit more about Supergoop! Maybe then I do.</p><p>Cause have you found these, but I think they've probably got more than three products. Is that right?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Meredith Schoenberger: </strong>Yes. Oh yeah.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matthew Smith: </strong>So right. So I would expect why not go ahead and show, shop all products or something to get us into something a little more. Now that said they may have done some testing and found out that it was more effective to just focus on three, but I would love to know data around that.&nbsp;</p><p>So let's jump over to the next email and, and talk through it. Cause it's a little different. What do you all think is working here and what draws your eyes out? And then we'll jump over to the advertising that connects to both of these.</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/422281d2590b45aa936f19bcc450ea06""></p><p><strong>Meredith Schoenberger: </strong>Perfect. I think that one thing that stood out for me within this email is that they're embracing the idea of UGC. So user-generated content, and this is something within ads that we really, really encourage brands to seek out to secure, and then to utilize it. We're constantly using UGC within ads and we seel like a huge, huge response in terms of clicks and purchases through that type of creative.&nbsp;</p><p>To see it utilized in an email, felt a little uncommon in a really good way. There was something, you know, obviously the UGC just from looking at the photo, we always say like, you know, you don't want to be using user-generated content.</p><p>That's low lighting and looks generally just not attractive and good. You want a pretty picture that feels authentic. That represents the brand. And she is glowing.&nbsp;</p><p>I thought it was really fun too, that they kind of tied in that cute icon, that little doodle that's kind of reminiscent of the emoji. You know, that kind of like a glimmer shimmer emoji.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matthew Smith: </strong>Yeah. And you all, I've on your video recently, I noticed you talked about this and the addition of this to this email adds so much, even though it's a tiny detail, because otherwise it feels fairly like, you know, it's just a photo dropped into a kind of a, you know, a canvas image here or canvas kind of background, but this little detail adds this nice little doodad finesse that breaks the border and just makes it feel a little more customized and, and handmade, like you sense personality coming through in it. It is effective.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Meredith Schoenberger: </strong>Yeah. And kind of just to piggyback off that, it just feels super friendly, which is the tone and the feel of their brand.</p><p>And so constantly thinking about, you know, in ads, like what is the tone and the feel of your brand? What are you trying to communicate? And mostly like, what do you want future potential customers or current customers to walk away feeling? And that is perfect. Like you see that and you're like, Oh, that's really, that's cute.</p><p>Which for Supergoop! is their vibe. And then I think. Again, like Supergoop! does such a great job of taking content and turning it into an experience for customers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matthew Smith: </strong>Do you think that this is, I mean, you're probably about to say I'm, I'm fascinated by this. So do you think that this is content that they went out and did some surveys or maybe in their user journey? They've gathered some of this information and the sense is these are tied, although they might not be. And this might not even be a user-generated content, but it's sure. It feels like it is right. And it's so effective. They don't, they never say anywhere that it is. And I'm like, Oh yeah, cool.</p><p>That's and now, okay, I'm going to get geeky here for a minute. There's a great, great book called understanding comics, which is whenever anybody's like, Hey, what books do you recommend for design? Oh, understanding comics by Scott McCloud. And they look at me like are you cuckoo? I didn't say comics.</p><p>No, just listen to me. It's all about abstraction. It's all about understanding the visual language, right? So. It's sort of funny. This is a perfect example. This is a disc with lines around it and an arc within it and a color. That's all it is. But through symbolism, we understand it's a smiling sun.</p><p>That's freaking cool. Like that's how the brain works. Right? Well, this is also an abstraction in the same way that like we can watch Homer Simpson and relate to his stupidity because we go, Oh, I'm stupid. Like that sometimes in the same way we go, we like put ourselves into this little written setup.</p><p>Oh yeah. My skin is an investment too. Oh, huh. What's this unseen sunscreen. SPF 40. Ooh. I like smooth. I want to look dewy, whatever that means. And it sounds awesome. You know, so like it's just a fascinating abstraction. Like I'm able to get myself in there. Whereas sometimes when I look at fashion advertising, the advertising is so not me.</p><p>So other. Now that does. A different job, right. It creates FOMO and I'm not a fan of FOMO. And so I disagree with some of those ethics, but this doesn't feel like FOMO to me, this feels like empathy. This feels like a connection. So it's interesting. Does that, does that connect for you all? I feel like sometimes I'm cuckoo on some of this stuff.</p><p><strong>Meredith Schoenberger: </strong>No! A hundred percent and I think what's cool is we're constantly talking about how do you put your product in context?</p><p>And this whole Madlib is almost this like a sneaky way to contextualize it for whoever is reading it without having to be super obvious. So usually, you know, within the text, if you're going to try and use text within context, you're going to have to ask a question. So it would be like, why do you wear sunscreen?</p><p>You know? And in the mind, you know, unconsciously answers it or what do you want your skin to feel? But what's cool. Is that like, we're all so familiar from childhood doing Madlibs. We know what that fill in the blank means.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matthew Smith: </strong>I had forgotten Madlibs and I'm like, Oh yeah, that's what this is.</p><p><strong>Meredith Schoenberger: </strong>Yeah, yeah. And it's really kind of fun. And I think what you were saying earlier too, you know, I do sometimes hate the idea that advertising and whatnot is a little bit of smoke and mirrors, but at the same time it works so beautifully. It could be Jessie, the woman who is featured, maybe she's filled this out.</p><p>It could be someone on the team. It could be from surveys, but it doesn't necessarily matter.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matthew Smith: </strong>Here's one thing that I do think is interesting that I just thought of it based on what you just said is that I assume that it is Jessie. And if she were not up here, I would be like, what is this?</p><p>It wouldn't feel contextually connecting to me now, if there was a user quote, maybe, but there's a really good tie in from Jesse being up here to this, that they almost need each other they're symbiotic in some way. Does that, does that feel that way to you all as well?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Meredith Schoenberger: </strong>Yeah.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ben Philabaum: </strong>Definitely.</p><p><strong>Matthew Smith: </strong>It's interesting. Well, let's jump over and let's talk a little bit about these ads here. I'm going to close these windows and sort of focus, but tell me a little bit about how you see these performing. What what's working in this ad and how does it tie in for you?</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/3ed2ff5af83f4d8fa6b947e4706ee3fd""></p><p><strong>Meredith Schoenberger: </strong>Perfect. I'll talk about the creative and then you can kind of talk about the backend. One thing that we know works consistently across the board, no matter what is press. And so we're constantly telling clients and just people within the industry, don't abandon your press efforts. Because a really great headline or sentence from any type of publication can just really make a difference in your campaigns and specifically you're calling it out in the creative.</p><p>What we love is that this is going and playing into that. Myth-busting objection, busters. So everybody who is a sunscreen fan or, or aware knows that zinc sunscreen is a total beast. It's almost impossible to rub in. You know, you look like a snowman. So the beauty of this is that like, this is a revolutionary product and it's like a double whammy. They have this incredible press quote that describes exactly why this is better than traditional zinc sunscreen.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matthew Smith: </strong>So this is super interesting. I'm actually about to redesign my website and this is very affirming. I'm taking a different tack and I'm going to build the site off of testimonials and quotes, and that's going to be the entire center of the site and it's, it's just sort of a personal site. I haven't done a personal site in years and I'm wanting to build it off of what other people are saying about their experiences, working with Matthew Smith, rather than what I say, because it's so much more informative and you take it at a different level.</p><p>It's when you talk about yourself, it borders on narcissism. Especially when you're like, let me tell you about me. Oh, enough about me. What do you think about me? You know, like all that kind of stuff, but it's so powerful to hear what other people's experiences are that do the objection busting. I love that.</p><p><strong>Ben Philabaum: </strong>No. And I think, yeah, kind of like coming up with those ahead of time and just trying to read your customer's mind. So for you and the design side, maybe it's, you know, A lot of times it's when people see that first quote, it's like, Oh my gosh, he's pretty expensive. But if the testimonial is a, First&nbsp;I thought they were really expensive. But after getting the work, Oh my gosh, it was so worth it. Then, you know, someone sees that on your site and it's immediately like reframes that whole thing in their mind.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matthew Smith: </strong>That's so interesting. I'm getting so many ideas from this episode. Y'all I'm having a lot of fun. This is great. All right. Let's look at this one here. So this goes after that user-generated content again.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/1df7518ee4c449a1af875dec46aede31""></p><p><strong>Meredith Schoenberger: </strong>Yeah, absolutely. And I can probably almost guarantee that this is maybe somebody on their team. So something that we are constantly encouraging. Anybody who wants, who wants to listen is that like UGC doesn't necessarily have to be a customer.&nbsp;</p><p>Again you don't want to start only pulling testimonials and quotes from the people that work for your product, but a beautiful video that's well lit. Is super, super valuable. And sometimes that can be really, really like pulling teeth to get from a customer or, you know, specifically an influencer that can get expensive.</p><p>So an easy way to kind of workaround that is to have somebody that is a friend or somebody who works on the team to kind of film something that feels very natural, filming it on an iPhone. We're constantly talking about the difference between studio footage and kind of that rock-cut, dirty iPhone shot and clients are always so shocked to know that like a kind of rough and dirty iPhone video can outperform, you know, the $30,000-$50,000 studio video shoot.</p><p>And so really kind of encouraging people to go for it. And as long as you're not. Mixing and matching styles. And what I mean is sometimes you can get into that habit that like, if it's going to look kind of native, which is what we call it native to the platform, it should kind of almost a hundred percent feel native.</p><p>So wanting, I think, you know, Looking at this ad and looking at what they decided to do with the captions. That's the perfect example they could have branded that they could have made it look a lot more like Supergoop!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ben Philabaum: </strong>Like how they did the text treatment. Yeah.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Meredith Schoenberger: </strong>Yeah. But they chose to do it how you would kind of see it on Instagram, how an influencer would do captions. that like kind of look, you know, just generic. And then they kind of tie it in at the end with that ending logo, CTA screen, which is something we always encourage. Anybody who's doing an ad to do.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matthew Smith: </strong>So interesting. I love it. I feel like I'm learning a bunch. One of the things that it projects is this quality of authenticity, right?</p><p>Like there's a, a suspicion that comes in from brands because we're so used to seeing brands. Now, what will be interesting is in another. Three or four years, there'll probably be some suspicion around user-generated content as well. it'll be fascinating to see how we continue to evolve.</p><p>I think that the authenticity that comes with something like this, and I think at an ethics level, you know, we want to be careful about what we do. Like there's nothing in this that feels inauthentic or feels unreal. Right? Like they, this is a real person really using this actual product presumably.</p><p>That feels great. She is a good looking person, but not like an absurdly looking person or something like that. And I think there's an interesting quality there also appreciate that she's a person of color. That's nice to see here.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Meredith Schoenberger: </strong>I think what could have made this a problem would have been if they had put a testimonial that wasn't hers to it.</p><p>So I think what makes it feel kind of walking the line and still okay. Is that. They are not putting somebody else's testimonial over her footage. So rather they're just kind of giving us a rundown of what the product does just quickly, rather than saying like, Oh my God, this was the best sunscreen I've ever put on my skin.</p><p>You know? And then they like leave off who said that. So I think, and again to it, like it kind of tricks you, cause there's no sound to this video. And you're thinking that maybe there should be some voiceover or whatnot. So again, it's just kind of this mind trick.</p><p><strong>Matthew Smith: </strong>Do you all ever go and watch like the director overview of a cool movie you love?</p><p><strong>Ben Philabaum: </strong>Oh, it's been a long time, but I know what you're talking about.</p><p><strong>Matthew Smith: </strong>One of the things that I hate is like, I love the Cohen brothers and you'll watch, like, how did they make the Big Lebowski. And they're there in this incredible scene. And they're like, I don't know. Do you remember how this came together? It's this sort of weird it's I guess it just sort of happened. That was accidental.&nbsp;</p><p>And you're like, what? You didn't even intend that. And it's, I feel like we're kind of doing that. Like we're gonna, you know, someday hear from the creative director. Oh, that's cool that it worked that way. We'd kind of did that, but I just, I love these insights.</p><p>I think you all are drawing out some fantastic little tidbits. One of the things that we do on our Feedback Friday episodes is we. Write everything out in a transcript. So it'll be fun to have this written out, and people will be able to read it as well. And we can drop in other examples if you want, but this is great.</p><p>I feel like we've learned so much, but you know, I just, I think there's so much to be learned from the experience of all of these together. Just really impressed and what an interesting little case study that we can all learn a lot from. I think one of the next things that I'm excited about with our team on a Really Good Emails is, we use a tool called <a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/niftyimages/"" target=""_blank"">Nifty</a> images and enjoy working with them. And some other players do something similar, but it's the ability to actually take an image like this and use content from the user in this experience. So you can use it's a Photoshop file and then it takes data from.</p><p>The user database, and then you can set specific, like let's put, my skin is an investment into this part of the image as a field, et cetera. And if you follow our emails for a while, you'll see that we do some of these things. Like recently we did one for the tiger King, that whole series. It was fucking awesome. And it was so great.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Meredith Schoenberger: </strong>What a ride!</p><p><strong>Matthew Smith: </strong>Like, I haven't even watched them and I'm like, I know what's happening. And it was so cool. We came up with like different names for people, and we've done things where we've come up with names like rapper names or those kinds of things, but you could see how this idea would be an interesting way of using Madlibs to do something fun and interesting.</p><p>And just to push our, our listeners and our users to think a little differently. Like there's, this is a very achievable email. This is not hard, right? Like that's one of the things that I think is wicked cool about this is these are not absurd ideas, right? Like if you get to know your users, you can know their objections and then go after that.</p><p>Right. I think that's fascinating. I appreciate the insights you all have delivered. Is there anything else you want to end on? Any, a special note here that feels like an appropriate, last word on these emails or ads?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ben Philabaum: </strong>No, I don't think so. I think this is fun to kind of blend the two worlds of the email and the ad side and kind of parallels between the two.</p><p><strong>Matthew Smith: </strong>Cool. I love it. Well, you know, I'm gonna be a dad here and I'm gonna finish with a little dad joke. I love it. Really Good Emails, users. There's half of them that are going to snicker with me and then half that will probably vomit and unsubscribe, but why couldn't the bicycle stand up by itself? It was too tired.</p><p><strong>Meredith Schoenberger: </strong>I think I'm your audience for these jokes. I would come to watch your standup.</p><p><strong>Matthew Smith: </strong>My girlfriend hates when I tell these jokes, she's like, you make yourself look so stupid. It's like, right. But I love them. They're great too funny. Well, I appreciate you all. Thank you for your time here. Thank you for going through these awesome emails. I learned a lot today. I hope our users did too. Let's record another one soon.&nbsp;</p><p>Everybody have a wonderful weekend. It's going to be beautiful out there on a Meredith and Ben side. What are you all going to be doing this weekend?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ben Philabaum: </strong>Oh, actually, we're going backpacking this weekend. Yeah.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matthew Smith: </strong>Oh hell yeah you are. Where are you going?</p><p><strong>Ben Philabaum: </strong>Going to get into the woods. Going up to Sierra national forest. Trails are open up there right now. So good social distancing activity we figured and getting nature hook.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matthew Smith: </strong>Yeah. I love hearing that so much. I grew up backpacking and I'm an Eagle scout and got all my nerdy. Nerdy stuff done that way. So yeah, I love it. I grew up in Colorado, so a lot of hunting, fishing, backpacking, hiking, all that kind of stuff is awesome.</p><p>Well, cool, well, have an awesome weekend email geeks. Stay safe out there. Black lives matter. We support it and we're for it. We're learning like a lot of our other community and stay safe and healthy and COVID free. We love ya. Talk soon. Bye.</p>",whale,whale,,,"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 22:00:00 GMT"

One of our mantras at RGE is to build relationships, not lists. We chatted with Olivia Stapp, Customer Success Strategy Manager at Justuno, about some really good pop-up strategies. When thinking about why you want people to give you their information, thinking in this context should guide you better than anything else.",https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogImages/feedback-friday-justuno.png,,,,,,"<p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> What's up, Email Geeks? Welcome back to another episode of Feedback Friday. This week we have Olivia from <a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/justuno"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Justuno</a>, how's it going?</p><p><strong>Olivia Stapp: </strong>It is going wonderful. How are you doing?</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>Very good, excited for some Fourth of July festivities this weekend, but first some amazing <a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/popupexamples"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">pop-up examples</a>.</p><p><strong>Olivia Stapp:</strong> To introduce myself, I am Olivia Stapp. I've been with Justuno for about four years. I manage our customer success and strategy department so I look at a lot of pop-ups. I know the best practices and I've been doing this for a long time.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>For people maybe not familiar, what are email pop-ups? How do you use them? How do you put them on your site?</p><p><strong>Olivia Stapp: </strong>There are so many ways. One of the biggest ways, the number one thing, is email capture and lead capture. All marketers know how valuable an email lead can be, and that is Justuno’s bread and butter, what you would initially know us for. Then, on top of that, we do a lot of other things, including exit intent, trying to save those cart abandoners.</p><p>We also have a lot of different gamification features. There are so many different opportunities to use Justuno promotions on your website to help increase your ROI, to help your conversions, and to gather more leads. It is a very dynamic tool.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>Yeah, I feel that email captures have been around for a while but we're still seeing marketers experiment with the format and try new interactive components; how they show up or when they show up, and what kind of information you're displaying. It's always interesting to see different brands trying out new stuff.</p><p><strong>Olivia Stapp: </strong>We're constantly seeing new and innovative ideas, especially with SMS capture coming into the world as well. However, different appearances, like you said those gamifications, such as spin-to-wins, things like that. Not only making the email capture valuable to the customer because they're often getting a discount but making it fun to interact with as well.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>Yeah, I feel like people think they're a bit annoying, but I still think they work, closing a sale or capturing an email address, they’re still a very effective tool to make that happen on a page.</p><p><strong>Olivia Stapp: </strong>They are. Today, what we often say when people are worried about the annoying factor is the rules. The rules are a big thing, making sure that we're displaying things to people at appropriate times and not overwhelming them. That will make that field less annoying. I know often when I go to a site I look for them now because if I'm going to go and I'm already set on making a purchase, then I want my discount.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>Exactly. Justuno put together this awesome resource called <a href=""popupexamples.com"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">popupexamples.com</a>, featuring a lot of the pop-ups. I think we talked about some of the more common examples like capturing an email address and giving someone an offer. Are there any other unique ways people might be using these?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Olivia Stapp: </strong>There are so many unique ways. We have people using promotions on mobile devices to mimic a mobile menu, which is just a bottom promotion bar with some icons on it. It makes things a little bit easier to navigate in the mobile format.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the fun things I'm seeing a lot of clients do now is a post-purchase SMS capture. They’re having really good luck with expanding capture from just the standard, fire it when somebody is new, and just landing on the site, situation.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>Yeah, it seems like there are a lot of little variables you can play around with when you're asking them and when you're showing them. Plus, there are also opportunities to A/B test these forms and ask where in that sales-customer cycle you want to ask for some of that information.</p><p><strong>Olivia Stapp: </strong>Exactly and A/B testing is one of the powerhouses of Justuno. Nobody knows your audience like you know your audience, and so the best thing is testing things that have worked. Everything from testing imagery, to a lifestyle image on the promotion, to different copy, to different offers; it's all about finding what works best for your audience.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>There are a couple of different brands that we saw that had pop-ups in the wild and I thought we could feature them and talk through some of the good and bad parts of them.</p><p><strong>Olivia Stapp: </strong>Yeah, that sounds great.&nbsp;</p><p>This specific promotion is very, very unique, but it works in a lot of ways because of its uniqueness. With welcome captures people often, and I know we just touched on it, but people can think they're annoying.</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/b3d799b8703e454bbb9c318dc19227e3""></p><p>For a lot of brands that have a very clean, upscale aesthetic, like the one we're seeing here, a full-page center promotion may not be the best bet. However, we always do want to know in circumstances like this, that, with a lead capture being this bottom bar instead of a center main promotion, there is a very strong chance of seeing a reduction in engagement rate. So, in that lead capture, you will sacrifice a little bit there, but that's always something worth testing.&nbsp;</p><p>You can A/B test a banner capture versus a full-size capture to see which one your audience is responding to best. Sometimes people find the quality of leads, when they do something a little bit more like this, tends to be a little bit better because it's attracting people that want to engage.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>Yeah, I like this one. I picked this one out because it seemed like less in your face while still using a lot of the colors from the brand. It seemed pretty straightforward. I do agree that if you would have put it front and center, you might get more engagement, but I think this is a good placement for a brand that wants to let you know that they have an email list you can sign up for, but isn't overly aggressive with it, or right in the front.</p><p><strong>Olivia Stapp: </strong>Yeah, I love this. This is a great way to, as I said, be cautious of being too overwhelming, but also still making sure it's kind of out there.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a great example of something that stands out, that's fun looking, it's unique, but it doesn't have an offer. They are not offering you a discount percentage or anything. They're just saying, if you love us, you want to get to know us, then sign up for us.</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/be03e59e34514e2797c630789560a6d4""></p><p>Some feedback that I would give them on this is, collecting and asking for your name. This is another one where a lot of people use customization in emails, and so they do want to have that name in there as well. However, once again, for every additional field, you're asking for, you're going to reduce your engagement rate. You think about people and people very often will think that it’s a little bit too much effort.&nbsp;</p><p>There are always other things you can offer in your copy and I think that this brand has a lot of opportunities to test copy. They could make it a little bit more of an exclusive discount. For example, they have discounts and could send, “know when our sales are coming”. Having that exciting language to get on the newsletter when you're not offering a discount is helpful.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>Yeah I agree. I think with email captures, I like to set expectations clearly when you offer a form like this so people know what they're signing up for. I think a lot of people are used to signing up just to get a discount, but if it is something like a newsletter, even letting them know what day they can expect it or if it’s going to be a daily email. It's good to have some of that stuff be a little bit more upfront.</p><p><strong>Olivia Stapp: </strong>That brings up a good point as well; being really, really clear and honest with your audience about what you're offering. Making your language as clear to read and as simple as possible, is a definite best practice and one that they accomplish well on this promotion.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>Pushing some of these additional fields out maybe until the next page or even, I think what we do is sometimes we'll do a follow-up email and say like, “could you let us know some more information about you”, after opt-in. Especially, when some of these brands aren't even going to use your name all the time, sometimes you capture fields just to capture them, and your marketing team doesn't end up using them anyway so you might as well reduce the number of fields that you're including.</p><p><strong>Olivia Stapp: </strong>Let's take a look at some exit offers. I want to make sure we can get through all our different fun ones here. This one is super simple, but it fits with the website. It's not too jarring because it's not out of place. It's very, very simple, “there's still enough time for 15% off”. The 15% off is just an overall sitewide event, as you can see from the banner up top, so we can get that context. Reminding somebody of that big sale like, “Hey don't forget”, we already gave you this in the banner, but here's that second reminder. Also, that countdown timer that they have in the banner, it is awesome to see those.</p><p><a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/brooklinen"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/172a04dd19084f4595ebf1ebee13b22d""></a></p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>I like the design of this, it matches the website style, having rounded corners on this pop-up. Yeah, this caught my eye when I was exiting the site. It brought me back in to say, “okay, well I can finish this purchase”. It almost creates this FOMO thing of like well, I have this discount, I almost have to use it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Olivia Stapp: </strong>Yeah it's like, well what if I don't have that later?</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>Exactly, I think they do a great job adding some urgency and adding a little bit of FOMO there to get you to keep browsing or make that sale.</p><p><strong>Olivia Stapp: </strong>I usually very much tend to veer and veer my clients away from a lead capture and an exit promotion. The person is already on their way out the door, we are adding in an additional step, so we see a lot lower engagement rates with those, where the purpose of these promotions is to retain them there. Then, instead of doing the “Leaving so soon? $15 off your first order of $150”, doing something of “Leaving so soon? Here's $15 off when you purchase $150”. We're just giving it to them because with the purchase, we have another opportunity of obtaining the email address. The extra step of entering the email could potentially detract people from taking the offer up.</p><p><a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/moment"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/1ecd08b298da4815ae3e181662437062""></a></p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>Yeah, did you have any insights on making someone go to the welcome email to get that coupon code, or would you recommend showing it right away on the site?</p><p><strong>Olivia Stapp: </strong>Right away on the site. We want to make it as easy as possible for those people. When we use the version of, not displaying it on-site and using it for email, that's for people who are getting a lot of spam or throwaway emails. You can use things like <a href=""https://www.briteverify.com/validityverify/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">BriteVerify</a> and different things like that to validate emails on the site as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, I love this.</p><p><a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/recess"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/fe19da9314544e2d8af6fa30413be3f4""></a></p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>I thought it was interesting where they really weren't asking for anything and maybe that's because they know that I already opt into these emails, but I just thought some fun CTA copy like “wow, thanks” and letting you know that you might get something added to your order, plus a discount, is a cool way to give a very time-sensitive offer on the page rather than something more generic.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Olivia Stapp: </strong>Yeah, this is definitely something that you could almost use as an exit promotion. When somebody doesn't have anything in their cart yet, this is that extra, “Hey, how about these additional things and this additional discount”, and it fits. It is so on brand. I cannot get over how on-brand this is and I love it.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a really good example of an alternative to a discount, doing a raffle win situation or entering to win something. It's a really good incentive for people to sign up. You get engaged audiences from it. A really large client I've worked with for a while, Pendleton, actually the blanket company, was regularly doing giveaways and had massive success with their lead captures.</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/cfe1a5258212437e813be3929fd234b0""></p><p>Yes, gamification is phenomenal. It is very good for upping that email lead list size. It’s one of those situations where you do have to be careful of people who are putting in emails to spin the wheel, but it does increase your lead capture rate, typically by multiple percent.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/9f02a0a3e88b413db6f543fd903f1b35""></p><p>This is really simple, it's from the side. One thing I would recommend on this promotion design-wise, and every promotion actually, is adding an additional close button underneath the spin button, only because we don't want to interfere with the experience. We've decided to play something in the way and we want to make sure it's as easy as possible so it doesn't interfere if they are on a conversion pathway essentially. It’s really simple. It's on-brand and I enjoy the copy on this. I really love when people have fun to brand copy, making things look on brand and making your language speak to your audience is so important.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>I've never used one of these, but I've heard a lot of people talk about them and I’ve seen them on other sites. It’s definitely something to test and you see that lift, but I think this brings a fun and interactive element towards just a regular opt-in. It makes you feel like, again, maybe some FOMO that you won something or something like that. It brings that interaction of opting in a little bit more exciting.&nbsp;</p><p>I found this one to be cool and I haven't seen anything like it before.</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/5b09ffc99afe49bfb88f80e14aafabb9""></p><p><strong>Olivia Stapp: </strong>This is what we would call pick a prize. It's a template we offer now, it's a plugin we offer now that we just built out. You can do something similar where you can upload images, and one of them will be the winner. With these, always, it's making sure we're getting them in front of people at the correct timing, not just putting something like this on landing. We suggest delaying it a bit so people have a chance to settle into your site before. This also assures that anybody who accidentally closes that out doesn't do that as well.&nbsp;</p><p>This has a lot of opportunities for testing. For some brands, when you look at things like this, it is really simple, and for some brands that works well. For some brands simple is the best option, especially depending on your audience. They have a lot of opportunities to test, and even testing a welcome screen, that would be adding in a screen ahead of it that just says, “Hey, would you like a discount today?”, a yes or no, or “how about opting-in”, something like that. That leading language has a really good impact on positive engagements.</p><p><a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/bridge-burn"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/9796a68304454c05a52ac9c4a1132d06""></a></p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>This is very simple, you don’t have to read too much on what you need to do, but I think there might be opportunities too, after you receive that email, on that confirmation slide on this page. I would be interested to see what that looks like if they give you your code here, or say, “share this”, or a referral or something. I feel like that confirmation is a second chance, there's a lot of opportunities to try out new things. I know we've tried out a social share.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Olivia Stapp: </strong>Yeah, we just had a request for that and I have a client who's now asking for Facebook likes via their thank you page as well. I think there's a lot of opportunities for those thank you pages and they're now starting to be a little bit more utilized rather than being an afterthought like you just said.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>Alright, for this last example, they're asking for the double opt-in, both email and phone number.</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/b5cd34cf927148fabb363a3376806a41""></p><p><strong>Olivia Stapp: </strong>Love it, I’m glad we finally pulled one of these up. I would recommend testing, doing the capture on one page versus splitting out that capture.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>I agree. I feel like there's some hesitancy when people ask me my phone number right away. I think we've said in a previous episode when you get someone's phone number, it's like they’re a super fan. So, sometimes, asking for that right up front when I don't know a lot about your brand is a lot for me to give you my phone number, just to get 10% off something. I know some people only have an SMS strategy and they don't even use email in the same way. I mean if you had to recommend email versus phone number if you only could pick one, which one would you pick?</p><p><strong>Olivia Stapp: </strong>I would say email on desktop and mobile on mobile.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>Oh, interesting, I like that strategy.</p><p><strong>Olivia Stapp: </strong>Yeah that's usually my strategy, it's worked out well for a lot of my clients. They're not sacrificing anything it feels like because they have a very valuable email.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>I'm sure we gave people a lot of examples to walk through and I'm excited to see what people try out. I see <a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/school/do-email-pop-ups-work"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">pop-ups</a> sticking around on the web for a minute because they continue to work pretty well.</p><p><strong>Olivia Stapp: </strong>They are not going away anytime soon and they’re really helpful in a lot of ways. Justuno is a super powerful tool and there are a lot of really unique and fun ways to utilize the tool as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>Great, well thanks so much for taking the time. I appreciate you jumping on here and Justuno has a lot of good resources as well so check them out.</p><p><strong>Olivia Stapp: </strong>Have a good one.</p>",mtthlbg,mtthlbg,,,"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 22:00:00 GMT"

Welcome back to another episode. We have Kasey Luck joining us once again. Today, we’re reviewing Buoy. <a href=""https://justaddbuoy.com/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Buoy</a> is a brand we’ve had on our radar. We have a few of their emails on the site, and I think we even mentioned them in the Really Good Emails Awards last year. They do some fun things, but we’ve never done a Feedback Friday on them before, so I wanted to get your perspective. Right off the bat, we get this very eye-catching red.</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/0b667a1f25e249f98548c122cdfaa92f"">(<a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/the-rainforest-does-it-better"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">See the full email</a>)</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck:</strong> Very intriguing.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> We’ve talked about this before, but the all-image lockup does feel a bit like a Photoshop file. That said, they do include sections with live text, which I’m excited to look at. As a hero, this works well. I like that they added supporting copy for the CTA. It’s not just “Shop now” or “Learn more.” Tying it more closely to the message works nicely.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck:</strong> I like that the paragraph text is short and adapts well to mobile. It’s very easy to read. That text isn’t live text, though, right?</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> Nope. One thing your AI prompts actually pushed me to analyze more closely was CTAs. One recommendation was to focus more on the benefit or outcome. This product might relate to immunity or longevity, so instead of just “Shop,” it could say something like “Sleep better tonight” or “Feel stronger every day.” Connecting the CTA to the outcome could be interesting to test.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck:</strong> Yeah, AI is going to put us out of our jobs.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> Definitely. But I think AI can help with thinking through alternative tests. The human perspective still matters.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck:</strong> I agree. That’s a great point.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> Then they transition into live text, which is great, followed by a section explaining the nutrients missing from multivitamins.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck:</strong> This is a lot of text and feels very educational.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> It feels like reading the back of a product box. It makes sense, but I’d probably lead with customer testimonials before diving into heavy science.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck:</strong> Or show the transformation first. What’s the outcome you’re actually selling? That would convince me more than this.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> Especially with supplements, people are skeptical. They don’t want to waste money. We’ve also seen less interest in supplement emails recently. Testimonials could help provide reassurance. The next section, though, is actually my favorite.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck:</strong> The deep red, the live text, the contrast. Everything really pops. The most seductive thing you can do for Matt is live text.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> Yes. Dark background, good contrast, live text.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck:</strong> I agree. This section works really well.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> On mobile, it’s slightly harder to follow, but it still works. On the desktop, the image and text paired with a strong CTA are excellent. This is the section that really made me want to click.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck:</strong> I love the headline, too. “No red flags” ties perfectly into the social proof and the red theme.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> One thing we’ve talked about before is that five-star ratings can sometimes feel less believable. Uneven numbers, like 4.7, can feel more real. That said, stars are still the clearest way to signal reviews.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck:</strong> I agree. Visually, stars immediately tell you this is a review section. Especially paired with the headline, they do their job.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> I also like the shoppable section at the bottom, especially on mobile. These bottom quick links are becoming more common.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck:</strong> I’m a big hater of top navigation menus in emails. We’ve tested them, and they usually lower conversion rates. They distract from the main purpose. Having navigation at the bottom makes much more sense.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> Social icons used to be a bigger deal. Most people don’t click them now, but I like that they only include the platforms they’re actually active on. The footer feels clean. For me, the hero could use a bit of cleanup. That would really push it over the edge.</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/c3c407931f584a3d9f1d5ab40d49aa0e"">(<a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/slept-the-best-i-have-in-weeks"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">See the full email</a>)</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> Alright, let’s move to the next email. I really like how this brand uses different color themes for each product and fully commits to them. Each product has its own color story, and that really helps the emails stand out.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck:</strong> That’s great, but it’s always a challenge to keep things fresh while maintaining brand recognition. You want people to immediately recognize the brand, even without reading the text. That balance is hard to strike when you’re changing themes often.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> Yeah, even if the logo wasn’t here, I think I’d still understand what the product is. They’ve used their brand identity consistently enough that I could identify this email in my inbox even without the logo, which is really nice.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck:</strong> Can we look at the red one again? Do they use packaging as well? Yeah, they use packaging here, and it has a very distinct look. They also use it again in the hero, which really helps. Even with very different color themes, it makes the brand immediately recognizable to me.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> I like these little callouts, too. There’s an image lockup at the top, but I really like callouts like this. I like the background color and the highlighted, boxed style. It’s a different approach than just changing the text color, and for some reason, it stands out to me. I don’t see this done often, but when it works, it really connects with the product. It’s also still pretty readable on mobile. I like this one.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck:</strong> Visually, I agree. But I do wonder if their audience actually knows what all of this means, because honestly, I don’t know what most of these callouts mean.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> That’s true. How many phytonutrients do you need? I have no idea.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck:</strong> That feels like a lot of nutrients.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> Exactly. I might not be getting enough, but to your point, maybe these callouts could focus more on people’s problems instead. If this language makes sense to their audience and it’s important to them, that’s fine. But using lingo people don’t understand might not be the best approach. What do you think about this long CTA, this chunky button here?</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck:</strong> How long is too long? It’s a little long, honestly. And what doesn’t help is the complicated wording. “Activated magnesium” feels like a lot. I can live with this button, but something feels off. In this section, there’s a lot of text, and it feels jumbled. They’re trying to create separation with spacing, but it still feels disorganized.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> There’s no clear separation between sections. Maybe adding a visual divider or an arrow could help block things out a bit more.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck:</strong> What do you think about the button itself?</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> I think it’s right on the edge. I’ve seen two-line buttons before, and that feels insane to me. As we talked about earlier, maybe there’s a way to make it shorter and more outcome-focused. Something like “Sleep better now” instead of this longer phrasing could be a good A/B test. As we scroll down, I really like the use of live text here. Then we have this checkbox-style section, which I think is effective. A lot of brands are doing this. The styled bullet helps it stand out. If it were just a white bullet matching the text, it wouldn’t be as effective. Using a different color that ties back to the brand makes everything feel more cohesive.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck:</strong> I love the contrast. This actually reminds me of the Single Slice event in San Francisco. The dog brand that was reviewed on stage used a very similar green.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> Yeah, similar brand colors for sure.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck:</strong> I really love this color. It’s such a bright green.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> This palette works really well. It’s not quite millennial green, but it’s close. I’ve seen a few brands use this, and it feels smart. It’s kind of like a tennis ball color. This section works overall. As you scroll, maybe not every element pops equally, and they could focus more on the most important factors, but as a lockup, it works pretty well. If it were live text, it would be even better.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck:</strong> I wonder if we need a button here. How far up is the button?</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> I could see adding one underneath. What’s interesting is that the italic text works earlier, but here it starts to feel more like legal copy.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck:</strong> I was thinking the same thing. One thing that’s not working for me is having too many different text formats close together. Each font or style change forces the reader to adjust.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> We sometimes call this design golf. Too many shifts in typography ask a lot of the reader. There’s a lot of adjustment happening throughout this email. Now we get a similar lockup to the one in the previous email. They’ve reused the same structure but swapped the brand color and images, which is smart. It feels like a different email, but with a consistent layout.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck:</strong> The contrast with the stars here is tough. Other than that, this section works well.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> Maybe the stars could be a slightly different shade of yellow to stand out more against the background. I do like the free self-stirring mug. We’re seeing more brands offer free items instead of discounts, which I think is smart. It feels like a deal without actually discounting the product.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck:</strong> My question is, why is it so far down in the email? I’m interested in the mug.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> I also don’t know what it looks like, which would help.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck:</strong> Either way, I’d mention it higher up. If not for magnesium, I’d click for the mug.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> The mug is a great benefit. Then they transition into a tip section. Nice use of live text and arrows in the headline. It’s cute. The rounded corner lockup makes sense, too. That’s definitely a trend we’ve seen. Rounded corners help soften the brand. They’re using that treatment consistently across images, and it works well for a footer. It ties the different products together nicely.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck:</strong> The final CTA mentions securing the last ones. Are they running out?</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> Maybe it’s seasonal. If it’s hydration-related, that would make sense. It’s interesting because this email isn’t really a product launch. It’s educational, then features, then reviews, and it ends with a seasonal angle. It’s a cool approach. They cycle through different color sections across emails, reusing layouts but swapping elements and colors. It’s interesting to see.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck:</strong> Overall, both emails do a lot of things visually really well. But I’m not walking away with a clear understanding of what the products actually do for me. Even when I read more closely, I’m still left wondering. I understand that their magnesium is more digestible, but why do I need magnesium in the first place?</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> True. I think they could talk more about why people use it. A lot of people take it for sleep, because it helps them sleep better. But like in the previous email, I’d bring that up much earlier in the main section. Right now, the problem they’re presenting is that the food you’re eating isn’t delivering what you need, so you need supplements. But to your point, you still need motivation to click. For me, it’s the missing urgency or motivation that makes the pain point feel immediate. That pain point, or a bonus like the self-stirring mug, or limited stock, belongs in the hero to drive the click.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck:</strong> And again, maybe I’m not the target audience. Maybe everyone else knows what “my medium is for you” means.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> Alright, now we’ve got this last one. Phytonutrients, another fun word.</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/a54ccb232dcb47e2b4b70c68eaa65a9e""></p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> This one feels weaker to me because it’s very long. There are some interesting sections and design choices, but overall, it feels like a lot. At the top, they’re clearly trying to make the product eye-catching, but again, the text isn’t live. It’s locked to an image and doesn’t work well on mobile. I’m also seeing this blue border. I’m not sure if that’s just how we’re viewing it or if something is breaking, but it looks unintended. As we scroll past that, we get into this comparison section. These “us versus them” tables are becoming more common in emails. What do you think about this approach?</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck:</strong> I love the idea, and I think they executed it well. It’s challenging to do this in email because the width is limited, but they’ve handled it well on both desktop and mobile, especially on mobile. That said, the table feels too long overall. It looks daunting. Even though it’s designed well, I still don’t want to read it. From the brand side, I understand why this happens. Everything feels important, so you want to include it all. I’d experiment with making it shorter and being more intentional about what stays and what goes. That’s my main note. What do you think?</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> When I looked at it, some of these pain points don’t feel that important to me. If I’m not well-versed in the category, I care more about things like price per serving. Is it cheaper than other green powders? Some of the features here are convincing, like third-party testing, but overall, it’s still a lot, and it doesn’t focus enough on benefits. It’s also hard to know what’s actually true. They’re probably comparing themselves to something like AG1, but some of these claims could apply to other products too. I do like that the chart is live text, and this “us versus them” framing can be effective, but it’s always interesting to see which data points they choose to include. We’re definitely seeing this trend more often. It can be a useful marketing tool when done well.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck:</strong> Yeah, it definitely helps position your product clearly when it’s done correctly. This seems like a sizable brand, so they must know what they’re doing. But they lead with “phytonutrients” very heavily, and they use many terms that require education. I wonder how effective that is. If you keep talking about phytonutrients, you also have to keep educating people about them, on top of everything else. A lot of this feels very science-heavy to me. I’m into health and wellness, but even I don’t know what some of this means.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> Yeah, some terms can be confusing if you’re not familiar with them. Scrolling down, it’s nice to see more live text. That’s one reason this email stood out to me. The stacking on mobile makes sense. But at this point, we’re pretty far from the CTA, and I’m starting to feel like I need a button somewhere. This is a long email.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck:</strong> Honestly, the CTA should be right after the table. That’s supposed to be the convincing part, and that’s where I’d want to take action, click to learn more, or even buy. I would definitely add a button there.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> As we keep scrolling, it starts to feel like we’ve read so much that the email is saying the same thing in different ways, over and over. Some of this may matter to certain people, but for me, it would be better if it were shorter. This layout also isn’t my favorite compared to something more live-text driven. It’s fine, but again, a CTA here would help. It feels like I’ve read the benefits and I’m ready to purchase, but instead, they keep giving more information. This comparison also feels weak because it looks like the same image, just larger. I understand they’re trying to explain something scientific or complicated, but to me, it starts to feel designed by committee. It feels like they included everything they wanted to say, even though people will only read about half of it. At that point, you have to ask what can be cut. Could a section like this be removed, or could it be its own email? It becomes a laundry list, and it’s hard to tell which takeaway is most important because there isn’t enough hierarchy.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck:</strong> I do want to defend the brand a little bit. In a previous episode, we reviewed emails for a pelvic health brand, and it was important for them to deeply educate their audience. Their audience actually reads long emails. This could be similar. Maybe this audience needs that education; they’re into the science, and we just don’t connect with it. It could also be something they’ve A/B tested. For some brands, shorter emails perform better, and for others, longer ones do. If they’ve tested this and it works, then that’s fine. But they’re definitely missing buttons.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> Yeah. I think what’s missing is a clearer “so what” section. The information might be helpful, but what does it actually do for me? Does it mean higher quality? Does it mean better results? I still need a motivator and a clear CTA that tells me what to do next.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck:</strong> What does that yellow box say about the US government higher up? It looks like a study excerpt, but again, it doesn’t tell me what difference it makes to me. It’s a lot of numbers and very technical. Is the takeaway that I should have more vitamin C? That’s what it sounds like.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> That sounds like a personal issue, Kasey. To your point, in the other email where we saw a clinician or a scientist, I feel like I need that here too. I need a scientist in this email. Someone holding a test tube would really help me understand that this product is actually better for me.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck:</strong> Yeah, the US government study is interesting, but I don’t know if it’s meant to be believable or not.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>Some of this information might be helpful, but when I think about what actually motivates me, it doesn’t quite get there. This feels more like landing page content that could be important to someone, but for me, it’s not enough to drive the click. Based on some of the email breakdowns you’ve done, there are different levers you can pull. Education is one of them, but for many people, levers like urgency, price, or scarcity are often stronger. Without some of those elements, getting the click becomes harder, and the email starts to feel more like a generic newsletter rather than something with a clear message or point of view.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck: </strong>&nbsp;I also don’t know how much this product costs. I’d assume it’s on the more expensive side, and if so, they should be doing more to address price hesitation, as you mentioned. Things like showing the price per serving, or using other smart ways to frame cost and value so it feels more approachable, would really help. We haven’t seen that across these three emails, and I think that’s a significant missed opportunity.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>Yeah. Alright. Then we get to this small lockup section here. Here it is, the free mug, in red.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck: </strong>I don’t know why it’s so far down in the email. From what we’ve seen, they’re actively prioritizing product education and focusing on educating their audience. But maybe the free mug is actually what gets people to convert.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>Yeah. I think sometimes brands expect people to read an entire email like a book. The real question is: where is the most important information? If you want to include secondary sections, that’s fine, but they could live underneath the main call to action. At a certain scroll depth, I should already have all the information I need to make a decision. I can always read more below. If some of these elements are meant to drive purchase, a clear value-add, like a free item, really stands out. That could have surfaced earlier. Overall, the email could be a bit tighter. We don’t have the full context. Maybe they have a strong abandoned cart flow where additional levers come into play. The emails are very beautiful and well-designed, but when you look more closely at the content, you start to see opportunities to test and improve.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck: </strong>I agree.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig: </strong>Awesome.

Welcome back to another episode. We are joined once again by a friend of the show, Kasey Luck. How’s it going, Kasey?</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck</strong>: Hey Matt, thank you so much for having me. It’s going great, excited to be here.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: We have some cool-looking emails this week, a little outside the normal brands we typically cover. I’m excited to jump in and learn a little bit from you about these emails.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck</strong>: My name is Kasey, as Matt just introduced me. I run <a href=""https://luckandco.agency/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Luck &amp; Co Agency</a>. We do email and SMS for e-commerce brands.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/e7ebaffbe9b14c95bd8793e82203ebdd"">This is still an e-commerce DTC brand, but it’s definitely very different from any other e-commerce brand you’d encounter. They sell sexual wellness products. Something that’s a really important distinction here is that it’s not sex toys. Its products help with various issues that people experience during intimacy. This brand was previously called Ohnut, because that was the hero product that they started with. This one, yep. That’s what the brand used to be called, but they introduced another hero product, Kiwi, which we see a little bit higher up. So they rebranded as <a href=""https://thepelvicpeople.com/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">The Pelvic People</a>. Generally, their mission is to help individuals experiencing intimacy issues or pain find a solution.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Yeah, I like this one. I think they do a really good job of making what can be a more taboo subject feel more approachable. It feels like you don’t have to feel any shame around this or anything like that. I really appreciate the inclusivity in the product messaging and their marketing efforts. It’s really nice to see.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck</strong>: One thing that was very important to The Pelvic People team when they were discussing a partnership with us was that their relationship with their email subscribers was a significant brand asset. Before working with us, they had been handling email in-house and sending a large number of educational emails. They didn’t send emails very frequently, but the ones they did send were very meaningful and often not overly product-focused; instead, they were educational. They had that relationship with subscribers where people would reply to the emails and share their stories. They had that connection. I can understand how it’s very scary for a brand to bring in an agency, an external partner, and give that relationship to an external team. One of our key objectives was to preserve the relationship they had with their subscribers while also improving performance and generating additional revenue. It’s a delicate balance of education, engagement, and product promotion, all while selling. That’s what we’re going to see across these emails. For context, this is a welcome email that was created by their in-house team. It wasn’t created by the Luck &amp; Co team, but the rest of the emails we’re going to see for this brand were created by our team.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Cool. First, I really like this imagery. It doesn’t really feel staged. It’s not the typical kind of imagery you might associate with certain products. That emotional connection is a nice way to lead into this messaging. I really like the contrast of the orange and yellow. It makes the CTA pop out. As we were talking before this episode, it would be great to see some of this as live text, especially something like a promo code. If it’s not live text, I’m unable to copy it from the email to use the discount. Some of those accessibility pieces would be nice to see. But leading down into the messaging, it’s pretty clear what people want me to do.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck</strong>: Yeah, I think one challenge for them is that part of the brand’s visual identity is these gradients in the background. It would probably be difficult to match the background color if we’re doing live text to fit into that gradient. That’s probably a choice they had to make in this email. I agree it would be great to have the code be copy-pastable. Copy-and-paste ability is more important for conversion, but accessibility is also crucial.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Scrolling down, I think we’re hit with a lot of text. For some people, this may be the ideal time to receive this information. Often, landing pages are better suited for presenting all this text, allowing people to delve deeper into product details. It does sound like personal recommendations. Is that based on some data? Do they fill out a survey, or is it browsing data?</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck</strong>: It’s based on the pop-up. It’s something we recommend to all brands when we manage pop-ups and flows. We also recommended this to them. In the pop-up, we ask questions that help us personalize content for that subscriber and make it easier to sell to them based on what they’re looking for. In their pop-up, they ask what you need help with: entry pain, deep pain, both, or just browsing. This email is intended for someone who has chosen both. So, for entry pain, Kiwi is the primary product that helps alleviate it. For deep pain, it’s Ohnut. That’s why we see both products in this email.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: For some sections of this text, I would like to see a table or some iconography to help tie the message together, making it easier to read. Obviously, this information is important, but perhaps there’s a more concise way to convey the key points and then provide additional details on a landing page.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck</strong>: Yeah, I can see that. It’s definitely one of the biggest challenges with brands like this. People need this information and are looking for it, but dumping it all at once can be daunting. People might think they’ll come back to it later when they have more time, and then they never do. Finding a way to say everything we need to say in a visually engaging way is a never-ending challenge.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: I really like this section. The pack idea is smart, and the bottom section makes sense. I appreciate how the email concludes and the footer, which encourages people to feel good about their purchase with various callouts. Overall, I like this layout and order. It feels like a design trend we’ve seen in a few places. If it made sense dynamically, maybe only showing one product if someone hadn’t selected both options could shorten the email. A shorter email might perform a bit better, but overall, I like this one.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck:</strong> I know they’re not managing their flows with us. The in-house team is handling that, and they’re running several A/B tests on this. I wonder if they’ve tested something shorter. If not, that’s a great test.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Cool. Next email here, hopefully this is one you made.</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/a8c1cff133054c9380ee2350a90b47f3"">I really like your use of customer quotes as subject lines. I haven’t seen many people do that, but it makes a lot of sense. You’ve said in other videos that using the language your customers use connects them more to the email, and I think that’s really smart. Some stakeholders believe they know how to discuss their product, but actually using the language customers use, pulled from reviews or FAQs, makes a lot of sense.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck: </strong>Yeah, we’re huge on using customer language and how shoppers think about the product and category.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Cool. There’s a nice, eye-catching hero text here that flows right into the CTA, which is really smart. I also appreciate how the image is integrated into the CTA, with reviews displayed immediately below. Is there anything that stands out to you?</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck: </strong>For context, Kiwi was still a relatively new product at this time. There was a lot of product education needed, and it was very important for the brand to make sure people understood this is not a sex toy and that it’s made for pain. That’s why pain is repeated often. We also leaned heavily on social proof, both from reviews and clinicians, which was important. What stands out to me is that the line spacing on the text feels a little tight. It makes it harder to read, especially in the reviews. That would be my main note.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Yes, I think it might be an issue with font weight or the fact that it’s not live text. The color contrast is fine, but the font used here differs from that of the website, which makes it a little harder to read.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck: </strong>I think it might just be a matter of line height. If we reduce the line height… I won't comment on the font choice because it’s likely a brand font they want to use, and there isn’t much flexibility there. Maybe it’s the weight or something about the font. It feels a little off, a bit funky.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: When you’re asking someone to read a lot of text, they might skim over it. As long as it’s readable, that’s the main thing. As you said, bringing in some additional elements really helps. Bringing in a professional here, this clinician, that’s a really powerful element. That ties everything together. It demonstrates social proof, and I've noticed that other brands do this really well. It’s smart to demonstrate that it’s not just other customers who think the product is good, but also that it’s backed by professionals. I think it answers many of my questions as I review this email.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck: </strong>And for other brands where this is relevant, being able to use this person’s photo is incredibly helpful. It would be much harder to do this if we couldn’t use her photo. Having the right assets available makes a significant difference.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: A founder photo or something similar can also be beneficial sometimes. I also like this gradient transition into the product shot here. It’s a smart way to end the email, and it makes sense as a little upsell or cross-sell.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck: </strong>This ties really well into what I said earlier about trying to connect with this audience and provide all the information they need. Something else we heard from the brand when we started working with them is that longer copy actually resonates well with this audience, and that’s what they want. As e-commerce email marketers, we’re often skeptical of that, so we tested it. And it’s true. This audience actually converts and clicks more when the email is longer, which is counterintuitive and very different from most e-commerce brands. Tying this back, one of the things we were trying to do was maintain all of that while also selling more. That’s where the cross-sell comes in.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: We’re always trying to make the sale. But you’re right, there’s no one-size-fits-all approach to email marketing. One thing we always say is to test with your audience. Just because you see a trend or someone gives advice online doesn’t mean it will work for your list. You really have to test and see what works best for your audience. Alright, moving on to the next email.</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/3866e30300e74047900b1858a234e69f"">This is a nice one with some different details. Initially, this one is a little hard to read for me because the text is centered across multiple lines. I think it’s about six lines here. Centered text over that many lines can be harder to follow. What are your thoughts?</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck: </strong>I remember when you hosted that live event, A Single Slice, in San Francisco with your partners. Logan kept saying how this was really bad.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: We won’t judge the email just yet, because there are some cool parts of it that I really like.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck: </strong>For additional context, this email is about lactation and was sent during the Mother’s Day period. This was one of their Mother’s Day emails, and it’s a great example of how this brand communicates in a way that truly connects with its audience. Rather than relying on generic e-commerce language, this isn’t what you typically see from brands during Mother’s Day. This campaign resonated really well with the audience, which reinforced what we had already learned from A/B testing: their audience is very specific, and this is what they appreciate. Not a generic “Mother’s Day, here’s 10% off Kiwi.”</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: I like this. Usually, I’m not a fan of the Z-pattern layout, but locking it up with rounded corners and making it feel more like a card makes it much more visually appealing and consumable. If this didn’t have a white background and instead just continued the blue background, it would be much less effective. This card-style layout works exceptionally well here, even on mobile devices.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck: </strong>I agree. I’m also not a huge fan of that layout in general.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: I’m always unsure how many zigs and zags are too many. Is it three? Is it four? But this one works. Then, linking the CTA color back to the design in this section is a smart touch. I really like this lockup. It feels strong. I also like this opt-out option. It’s nice to see that they’re paying attention to their audience and acknowledging that this topic may no longer be relevant to everyone. It’s more of an opt-down rather than a blanket unsubscribe, which is thoughtful.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck: </strong>Yes, we’re always mindful of which topics are relevant or potentially triggering for some people. For this audience, experiencing pain during intimacy can be very sensitive. Finding ways to stay relevant and helpful is really important.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Alright, last one here. This is a fairly lengthy and interesting email. Tell me about this one. This one is a “through-the-ages” style email.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/ae14f90d06c741cba6588da44aa97634"">Kasey Luck: </strong>I’m going to rely a bit on notes from the strategist who works on this account. Most of their audience experiences health issues and tends to be sensitive about them, which we’ve mentioned. Endometriosis is one of those conditions. It’s very common, but it can be difficult to diagnose and discuss. I actually have a friend who had undiagnosed endometriosis for most of her life. People like that struggle a lot. It’s constant pain, and no one can tell you what’s wrong. This email condenses one of their lengthy blog posts into a storytelling email that guides readers through the history of endometriosis, also known as “endo” for short. There is a link to the blog post, which is very important. From there, we transition into the products in a way that feels natural within the storytelling, and we introduce them without it feeling forced. We also include an advocacy block at the end. This was tied to a newer product category they introduced: merch. It’s all about advocacy, and tying that into the narrative was one of the goals of this email.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: I like this one. Ideally, it would be live text, but if that’s not possible, the imagery works well. We’ve seen numerous trends where timelines or scrolling narratives help keep people engaged. I really like the asides; they add a personal touch to the brand. On both mobile and desktop, it works well as you scroll through the story. It sets up background and context, and then positions the product as part of the solution. That formula works well here.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck: </strong>It’s long, but still much shorter than the blog post. The copywriter clearly had to work hard to decide what to keep and how to make it readable.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: To me, this works better than pasting the entire blog post into a newsletter. This section is a smart transition into a clear product lockup. It’s obvious what action you’re meant to take. Nice one. Thank you for taking the time to review these. They’re definitely a bit different from what we’ve reviewed in the past, but that’s what makes them interesting. Many of these emails have been performing exceptionally well. I always enjoy the challenge of working with more sensitive topics. Email is flexible, and when you really think about the people you’re communicating with, you can make the message feel relevant by putting yourself in their shoes.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck: </strong>Exactly. That’s one of the reasons I love email. You can’t really do this kind of storytelling as effectively in ads. Maybe in social video or stories, but that’s a different format. Email is great for building relationships with subscribers in the right way. It’s always a challenge, but a very fun one, working with brands like this. If this feels relevant, check out The Pelvic People. They’re really cool.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: We’ve been working on a tagline: “Build relationships, not lists.” At the end of the day, you’re sending emails to real people. They have real problems, and your product might solve them; how you communicate that is part of your job. Thanks again, Kasey, for taking the time. I really appreciate it. Have a great rest of your week.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck: </strong>Thank you. This was fun. See you. Bye.</p>",mtthlbg,mtthlbg,,,"Thu, 01 Jan 2026 23:00:00 GMT"

Woo. Feedback Friday. Feedback Friday. Okay, great. This week, we're taking a look at Athletic Brewing. So, a couple of us on the Really Good Emails team have gone sober. We're trying that out. This brand definitely stands out. It's quite a significant thing in the United States. You know, we see it in bars a lot. They are an alternative to beer. It's called Athletic Brewing. They target athletes who want to enjoy a drink without regretting it the next day. They have some really interesting emails that I thought we could review. </p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/f043484e734c4b81913ff0a706401c1d"">(See the full email <a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/trailblazer-hoppy-helles-back-and-blazin-trails"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">here</a>)</p><p>So this first one is one of the most popular saved on the Really Good Emails site. And what I like about it is, I really like the color palettes here. We're actually using Parcel right here to preview it, as we discussed before, but there are a few things we can examine. For instance, if we turn off the images here, they still do an okay job of using a lot of live text to make the image load. They could do a better job with some alt text, as we can see, especially in this area. But a pretty good job overall in keeping it really simple and still making each section stand out with unique colors. So, I thought we might go to the audience and have everyone share one positive thing they really like about this email, and then perhaps something they'd like to see improved in the future.</p><p><strong>Mike Nelson</strong>: This is something we do. We try to stay positive. You may find things that you don't like about this, but please also point out the aspects you do like about it. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: I love that hero. What a striking hero. Very aesthetically pleasing color palette. This is definitely something I dig. The only thing that I didn't love is that it looks like maybe reviews. Scroll down. There was a lot of text. Yeah. Trailblazing. Teammates. Okay. So it's like reviews, I think, from their team, I assume. I like that. I would like to see that condensed. I'm not likely to actually stop and read all of that. And I think, where's Gavin? Gavin's at? I think you could use a GIF here. A GIF GIF through, yeah, go ahead. Carousel GIF to condense it down to three frames instead. That would feel a little more engaging, perhaps a bit more eye-catching, and then consolidate that section a bit.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Yeah, I agree. I feel that when you see people's names, I really like to see their faces as the next step. Yeah. So you can connect with the person who's actually saying it, meet them, and be part of their team.</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: Yes. I am very lazy when it comes to email as a reader, and I prefer not having to jump through hoops. So the bottom couple CTAs where I could directly go in to order the brews or merch or find a store, I really love that, because I'm a lazy email reader.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: This is a trend that I really like to see; the alternative navigation bar is actually at the bottom. They are almost like these quick links, so you can jump around, but they don't steal the show right when you first open that email. So, putting them at the bottom, along with the social links, I really enjoy.</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: It's essentially translating a website-like experience into the inbox.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Hebig</strong>: This is kind of like that newsletter template, and I think they are kind of picking newsworthy sorts of things to include. They're maybe trying to sell you on this, but it's a light sell for sure.</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: Do you know what the subject line is?</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: That would be ""Trailblazer Hop. He's back and blazing trails.""</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: Cool. Do they also have a pre-header or a preview text?</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: I don't think they might have that actual hidden pre-header. Oh, there you go. There it is. Yeah, there it is. These are the ones for the trailblaze. Trailblazers.</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: It's cool. I personally quite like the colors throughout it. I like the CTAs; I appreciate how the background color comes through in the text. I think I saw on the bottom that the only thing I would be worried about is the color in dark mode, specifically how it would appear, and the contrast ratio - is it okay? And then the one other thing for me is, this is borderline, but the amount of center-aligned copy is, yeah, beyond four.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: I think three is usually what we like to see, but it can be a little long.</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: Yeah. But I think it's short enough for sure.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: And then, yeah, nitpicky as well, but even some opacity or some hover effects on these could be kind of a fun way to make these stand out a little bit more.</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: Could we please see the mobile version? I wonder how the alternative navigation bar at the bottom is implemented. Okay. Nice.</p><p><strong>Mike Nelson</strong>: I want to remind people that these are really top emails that we see, as we receive a lot of emails, so our nitpicking is just us being nitpicky. But we do love this. Would you like to proceed to the next one?</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Sure. We can take one more in the back.</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: So, essentially, the header, the headline, is not live text. Obviously, once you eliminate the imagery, the main kind of triumphant return, your main message just disappears. But other than that, really, really good. Love, love the colors. As Ben mentioned, the color contrast in some of the combinations is a little too close, but that's about it, really.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Yes, I completely agree with you that this headline should have some good alt text, and perhaps they could even style that alt text to match the blue color, potentially, or something similar. All right, we're moving on to the next one. Number two, a very popular email as well, see it pop in.</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/4bd24ca9df2d432db54bc42f9c1ae5fc"">(See the full email <a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/new-daypack-flavors-are-on-the-horizon"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">here</a>)</p><p>This one features a GIF, which makes it a little blurry, giving it a teaser-type email feel. Catches your eye. At least, that caught my eye. And a very simple layout, pretty similar to the previous email. I do think some of these colors might be too contrasting for me, but overall, they are relatively similar in tone. Just popping in some different content and trying to catch your eye a little bit with that GIF at the top. This may be moving just a little too fast for me, so I would consider slowing it down a bit. Any thoughts, feedback, compliments?</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: I do like that GIF. I find that difficult to read. And again, if it were live text, it might be nicer. Yeah. I think it was just annoying for me because it feels so simple. If they just pushed the can down a little, then the text would be fine. It is, I, I don't know who signed that off. Oh, what do I like about it? I like beer. There you go.</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: I like the concepts. I like quite a bit of teasing new flavors coming. I find this imagery very frustrating because that's what it looks like when I don't wear my glasses. So instead of being intrigued, I'm frustrated. I almost wish I could see something like that, maybe not a GIF, but something that shows multiple flavors, like how flavor or mixed packs come in a box. I think that would work better for me than this. I also don't know why the can is so big. It's fricking huge, you know.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Yeah. This is an interesting trend, like the blurred. I kind of like the more pixelated blur, almost like a censored thing, with maybe like an animation on that. I think they've carried that over from social media to email in some ways. And it always makes me want to click in and uncover what that actually is in front of me.</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: One thing I like, and one thing that could be cool. I like how, yeah, the GIFs slightly do my head in a bit, but I really like how the colors seem to blend into the live text, with that solid background. But it kind of looks like it's one thing, so that's quite cool. I'm not sure, but a hover effect would be quite cool. So, if you were to hover over the can, it would reveal its flavor as a small bit of interactivity. You can create a hover effect, swap the image, or even switch to another GIF image, allowing them to do something fun there.</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: I actually received the same positive feedback as Jim did, that the imagery seamlessly integrates into the live text in the background. However, the negative aspect is that when you select the first image in the previous email, it remains the same, I think. So the logo and the first image are actually the same. It's generally expected that when you click on the logo, you will be directed to the homepage. This means that the link is actually the same, so it leads to the same landing page. So that's the thing I don't like.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Yeah, maybe you could slice this or just have that as its own sort of thing.</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: Yeah. It's a small effort for something that should be best practice.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Yeah. Probably works better too, maybe for alt text, having that logo by itself. Yeah, have the more descriptive thing. And then one thing I did notice from the other email is that we're really pushing the center text for me here. It's getting a little long for that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: None of the copy inside the email matches the imagery or the call to action. And I think that's sad, because the copy is kind of okay. It could be better, but you could have so much more fun with the imagery based on what the copy is. And I often feel that in beautifully designed emails, there is a significant disconnect between what you're typing and the way the email appears. I just feel like it says, “Stay hydrated, drink Day Pack,” and then there is a conveyor belt of individual cans. It is just a total mismatch. It is not good for the brain.</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: As someone who enjoys a good beverage and shops around, I often find myself selecting drinks based on their can art, which is particularly prominent in alcoholic and alcoholic-adjacent beverages, as well as their design. Proximity to product, their can art is really, really close to both the other one and this one. And it feels like something I would pull off a shelf if I saw it in email form. They are very obviously cohesive and not jarringly separate.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Yeah, I agree. Alright, let's go on and try some different emails from them.</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/1e027fedcf1a442c8e01c16848307224"">(See the full email <a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/athletic-brewing-named-time-100-most-influential-companies"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">here</a>)</p><p>They claim to be one of the 100 most influential companies. They are thanking you for this. They include some live text up here, discussing their influential company. They have this signature. This is all center text again, which is getting a little hard to read. But I do sometimes like a signature in an email with a face, potentially. I do not think it always works in a letter form, but I think it can sometimes stand out if it is authentically done well enough. And in this GIF, I think it is a little big. I think it's about two megabytes, so they could maybe work on that. But overall, I do sort of like this animation to catch your eye a little bit. You know, I think they may be pushing this template a little bit more because it is “spread the word,” you are asking for a share, but maybe this is not the right sort of format to lay that out in. Any feedback?</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: First, I like the concept of sharing. You know, sometimes I think we forget that we are encouraging people to connect and share bits and pieces, or even reply. Email is a two-way channel, so getting people to take action with it is a plus. Whether it works or not, I am unsure about this option; however, I think that overall, I do not like emails being sent from a CEO or someone in a similar position. Who kind of cares?</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: I would like to say that I disagree with your opinion on that.</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: I personally don't like this, but if you do, it feels a bit too lengthy from my perspective. I think there is probably too much. If there is more to read, then direct them to a place where they can continue reading and potentially convert from that point. You are saying this is my opinion. Okay, I could be wrong.</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: I think that for me, when I think about local breweries in Vancouver, which is where I am from, and the ones I am on their email lists for, I feel a connection to them. I think this is a fun brewery that I enjoy visiting with friends or ordering from online. And to see an email from the founders, who have probably put in a lot of work, I would feel excited for them that they are on the Times 100 list. It's nice to have a refreshing email like this instead of the previous ones, which are telling me to buy. Other emails, like those from PBR or other big beer brands, if I received this email, I would be thinking, 'Why am I on your email list?' and congratulations, you are already a huge beer company. But ones like this I find a little bit touching, although I do agree that the quotes are too long and I wouldn't read them. But the excitement is there with them.</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: I get that, and I agree. I agree with that part. If it is a smaller brewery, then, yes, I suppose it does work from that point of view, but overall, emails from CEOs.</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: Yeah, I am going to back up Gavin on this one and say, first of all, Athletic is really big, so they are huge, at least in the US. So they are big. Similarly, many meetings could have been conducted via email; this email could have been shared as a social media post. So if I were the email marketer, I would say, We do not need to send the fucking email about this. Put it on social.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Yes, they might have done both, potentially, but this could be a little self-serving. I know this is intended to be a thank-you email, and perhaps they could have included a picture of the team or something from the brewery, you know, “let's celebrate this together.” However, perhaps this could be seen as somewhat self-serving in some ways.</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: I love how positive this conversation has been. The colors look nice. There is a balance again. These are, as Matt Cook says, strong opinions loosely held.</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: It is okay. I find it challenging to overcome the initial impression that the first image is somewhat overwhelming. You do not know where to look. It is full of text everywhere. Yeah, it is way too much, in my opinion. And they try to add a personal touch with the signature. It is a nice try, it is a nice touch, but it is not succeeding, in my opinion.</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: I will be brief. That hero, did anyone else read it as, like, “it is time to thank you”? Does it need a comma? I do not know. Yeah, it is like, yeah, “time thank you.” I thought they were thanking me when I opened it, or, you know, when we opened it.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> I think it is a play on both. I think it is both.&nbsp;I do not have an answer.</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: Oh yeah. The GIF at the bottom is really wobbly. I just feel seasick looking at it. If they stabilize the image, they will also save a lot on file size. Additionally, the imagery is generally of the tin. I do not know what is inside the tin. I understand that the can art is important and it looks good, but you could put a glass next to it with something in it, because I don't know what that is. It does not make me want to drink it unless I see it.</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: As a social person, I can say, Why would I spread the word? Can I win something? You need to provide something. People need a reason. They are not just going to do it.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Okay. Positivity train, moving forward. Okay. All aboard.</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/a10699d358564a7892f37fa13907449e"">(See the full email <a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/athletic-brewing-co-presents-journey-to-100-an-epic-adventure"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">here</a>)</p><p>This is another one, somewhat different from the newsletter, employing a different approach. I mean, I am impressed that they have been able to maintain the same number of templates while trying some new content, even if the templates are pretty simple. So I think this one is trying to tell a story to that 100. I kind of like this play button off-center. That could just be me, but I do sort of see that when you add a play button to a video, it may get more engagement. Perhaps not, but it's worth trying instead of just a “watch the trailer” CTA. Scrolling down, you see these dates listed here. Maybe this works, but I do like how it is a little more muted in terms of colors and tries to incorporate some of that branding. This one is a little longer than the others as well. And again, with that center text, maybe getting a little bit hard to read. Perhaps on mobile, they could try a left alignment at least, as this becomes quite difficult to read. Do you have any more feedback on these in the front?</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: Yeah. Hi, my name is Olga. I actually have a question. Are we still talking about a brewery that sells drinks? Because at first I was like, okay, we are talking about the same template, and I thought we were talking about the same product, but this looks like an athletic journey email to me about a company that does something like, I do not know, shoes for climbing or hiking, or something for climbing or hiking. Or at least to a point, I was thinking that maybe I will see a guy in a tent with, you know, the can that you can take with you. I'm not sure why you would take that camping, as I would assume it is heavy, but you could tie it in somehow. So, I loved the last emails because you could tell what the product was, and you didn't have to think. And then there's a tent screening, and I was like, 'What are we watching?' But overall, the email is very nice. I love how the image flows with the background. I mean, it is all very pretty. But just, like, what is the brand? What is the product? Why am I getting this?</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Yeah, it is interesting. It is almost like receiving a different type of email from them. It does, you know, they are named Athletic Brewing, so I do think they try to support athletes, and maybe they, it looks like they did make a film about their product, and, you know, or sponsored something that would hopefully, you know, now that you said that, they are like athletic growers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: Yeah, this is not a criticism at all, but it is kind of like, “oh, it could be interesting,” depending on how long the trailer is and therefore how big a video file size would be. They could even experiment with, and I appreciate this, only working on certain clients, such as embedded video, if they are trying to get people to watch the trailer and then book a ticket to one of the screenings. Something that we tried at my company was embedding a video, and we saw that it had a massive effect on people clicking through to the things we wanted them to click on. This was because they were less likely to leave to go to YouTube and get distracted by the sidebar or other content. So it could be something cool too.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: I also like the design. I think, generally, and also considering the emails as a group, it is really consistent. You know straight away; it is like, 'Okay, I recognize this brand, I get it.' One comment just about the GIF and the play button. I really, really like that they have backed it up with an actual CTA to click as well. So if you turn images off, you still get that button, and you are still pushing people to that. It is just&nbsp;a real minor thing, but I think it’s really good.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: One thing I noticed was the lack of personalization, whether it was using my first name or understanding my buying cycle. If I have already purchased this product before, you don't need to bombard me with the brand every time. But there is no personalization.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Yes, I would be curious to know what kind of segmentation they are using, but it does seem like a batch-and-blast, one-size-fits-all approach. I think they might have some, like, if you order, they might send you a survey about whether you enjoyed the product, and they might ask you if you want to reorder it or similar things. But these newsletter-type, wider-audience emails are relatively the same, I think.</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: Again, I, the lazy email reader. I really liked how the screening times are included in the email itself, because if I receive this, I assume they may know my location, and I can easily check if this movie or whatever is playing in my area. The one thing that I would want to see from them is, honestly, just a little timestamp of how long that trailer is. As I am a lazy individual, I want to know how long this video is before I click on it to watch. And if it is like a minute or two, I'll probably go in and take a look. If it is 21 minutes, I will probably start it and be like, “I will watch this later,” and then never go back to it. But that would entice me a little bit if I knew how long this trailer was.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Yeah, maybe mention the length in the body copy, like “a two-minute trailer” or something. That could be, if not on the image, like you said. Sweet. Alright. Any more for this one?</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/a546d3f4ce83435081367c359f04df96"">(See the full email <a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/celebrate-earth-day-with-protecting-the-trails"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">here</a>)</p><p>Okay. I think we have one more, and this one is celebrating Earth Day. So, keeping some of that branding that we saw in that previous email. I do sort of like the branding that they are able to do, as the branding is really important for some of these products to stand out from each other on the shelf. And this one always kind of catches my eye. I like how this sort of leads in and brings your eye down to this main copy header here. The text is a bit lengthy, but I think this really stood out to me due to the coloring, which makes it pop, and the way it flows seamlessly through this email into the different sections. So I think I would like to see when brands are able to do that. And then, down here, they do have a callout for text alerts, shout-out text alerts, which is a nice feature. They also have a little bit here, so a slight change-up, trying to capture some interest in these sections.</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: Can you go up to the top? That trademark symbol hanging out there is driving me bananas. I wish they could just move it to the end of the “T,” or, I guess, maybe if it is at the end of “Trails,” and just make it smaller. Unfortunately, I can no longer unsee it. And then the casing on all of their headlines is also driving me a little bit bananas. It looks more awkward on a few of them. So, super cute. The illustrations are amazing. But the casing, no.</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: I notice some inconsistency in their level of description, where they are overly descriptive in some areas and less so in others. If you go up, they wrote out “1 million dollars.” I feel like they could have just put “1M” and saved some space. However, when we reach the button text, I believe it was actually at the very bottom, offering the option to sign up or learn more. So I love how chunky their buttons are. I am definitely drawn to them, but “Learn more,” I wish that would be, like, when you are in the “get 10%,” you know, “join the club”. Literally anything else. It feels really lazy to me, just “Learn more.” It is not compelling at all. It does not refer to the sale, like the fact that I would be putting up money for it. Some of their copy choices are a bit odd, but I wish those CTAs did a bit more work to create intrigue.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Yes, it is something that, if saved, I think could be interesting. It is almost as if they ran out of ideas to keep it the same length as this one, potentially, and they missed the mark for me.</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: I love the illustrations. I might even hang one up in my room. It is really cute, the little van with the little tents. It is very Colorado for us. Yeah, I like that a lot.</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: Yes, I was also going to say that I love the illustrations; they feel like storytelling to me. You are scrolling through the email, and I am like, “Oh, I just could imagine, look at the stars, and there must be two people.” And then I see “friends on a mission,” and I think, “Oh, that must be friends.” And that can prevent, for instance, looking at the stars; I am thinking about the different constellations. And then, the images are truly awesome in the way they evoke certain emotions, which is awesome. And while I do totally agree that the CTA at the bottom about their club could use, like, what is it, a club? Is it an email list, an online forum, or a Facebook group? Do I need to pay for anything? Perhaps something like “Sign up,” or at the very least, “Join us at an event,” or something similar. But I do love how different the two CTAs are at the bottom. So, it is not something that is very noticeable in email, but on mobile, it totally loses its newness and uniqueness. On the desktop, it is very nice to see the two CTAs, and they stand out. It makes me think, “Oh, that is cool, not something that I usually see.”</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Yes, as you said, I think this is the right way to use a two-column layout. I need more smaller text; it would be kind of hard to read.</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: I love the color chunking of this from the perspective of ease of consumption. I would open this email again if their emails continued to be like this, because even if I don't care, I know exactly what I am supposed to pay attention to. And even the language is more relaxed, as seen in phrases like “Try” as a CTA. I do not wish to apply, nor do I wish to check out your partners, but I am not being bombarded with this information. I am not being bombarded with numerous logos, and, yes, this is a lot of text, but I can skim over it. I would happily delete this and open the next one, even if I hadn't clicked anything, because it is not causing me harm, screaming at me, or requiring me to do tons of visual back and forth just to understand what the thing is. Love that aspect of this.</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: Can we see what it looks like without the images? I was a bit concerned that this is inconsistent with the other templates, where there is a spacer between each one. I suppose this doesn't look too bad, but from a consistency perspective, it is a little off, even though the imagery is always impressive. And with the copy, it just seems long, so it's pure reading, center-aligned.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: For sure. I am glad that at least these are not baked in. I think I see many brands use their brand font as a header, and it kind of bothers me, to be honest.</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: Before we get into it, the center alignment is actually not that bad. So, if you take a look, they have a good example and a semi-acceptable example. Here, if you take a look at this chunk, it is pretty justified, with right and left alignment. And if you go a little bit further, this is actually not that bad of an example. If you go down, I think it is in the beige color. You have indents and outdents, right? So that is when you want to be more considerate about your center alignment. But if you can keep things pretty close to being justified, you do not actually have to worry too much about center alignment.</p><p><strong>Audience</strong>: Yeah. Seeing all these different emails, I wonder if they have some design guidelines. Because these emails look kind of, yeah, too inconsistent. There are some details that remain the same in each email, such as these chunky CTAs, but other than that, it feels like it could be an email from a different brand each time. So, yeah, the colors are different, and some of the other stuff is different as well.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Yeah, they are pretty loose, trying, I guess, to match some of these colors with the illustrations, or in the previous ones, the overall images. And I definitely think it is a good callout that when you are going to stack colored text over another color, you should check the contrast ratio to ensure it works. Okay, well, that is it for Feedback Friday. Thank you so much for reviewing these emails.</p><p>Nice job, Athletic Brew.</p>",mtthlbg,mtthlbg,,,"Thu, 11 Dec 2025 23:00:00 GMT"

How’s it going?</p><p><strong>Matthew Smith:</strong> Just cranking, man. Busy, busy as all get out, but having fun. Heading to the Grand Tetons with my kids soon, so that’s going to be fun.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> Oh, very nice. Maybe they’ll have a Chipotle there.</p><p><strong>Matthew Smith:</strong> Oh my God, I love Chipotle. I’m pretty into this. This is a great example of a fantastic GIF. It’s supporting imagery that just feels fun, right? If they had used a still photo, it wouldn’t be nearly as meaningful. I think they did a great job with that. I love it. Also, holy cow, that’s a lot of avocados, and it makes me hungry. I think they’ve done a nice job here with a lot of different elements. The one thing I notice right away is that this text gets very close to being too long for centered alignment. It’s nice and big, which helps, but that could become problematic. If it were me, I’d find a way to make it left-aligned.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> The hierarchy is a little strange, too. I mean, I guess that GIF text overlay is sort of the headline, but to me, it doesn’t really stand out as one.</p><p><strong><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/d4a90888b6ad4e878a0d0671628d98b0"">Matthew Smith:</strong> I do like how clean and simple things are. A simple email can be very effective. In my experience and opinion, most people tend to overdo it, so it’s refreshing to see something straightforward here. If they had used left-aligned text, I think they could still keep it within a narrower inner column, without stretching all the way to the edge. That would work pretty well. Another thing I thought was clever is this video callout. Using the video symbol for play makes sense, but adding this little bar underneath was a nice touch. The video player doesn’t actually look like this, but it makes you want to click. It’s more enticing, and I find that appealing.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong> Yeah, it’s like a hack. I’ve never seen that before, but I’d be interested in seeing how it converts. That’s cool.</p><p><strong><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/7918ca46ecfa413ba47e75128cc4a17a"">Matthew Smith:</strong> Yeah, it’s a nice visual hack. They’re also using the red from their brand throughout — in the video section and on the CTA — and I think that’s strong. “Yes, I want the guac.” Again, they’re using the same callout style. I’m curious — they’re doing something slightly different here than in the previous section. I’m not sure why. This one feels like it’s further along in the video; there’s a white line, and now there’s no play button. Maybe they’re testing which one gets more clicks. That’s interesting. Then they lead me quickly down the page to this recipe, or more accurately, a set of recipes. It just feels great to have that insight. The images look good — the picture of the ingredients is obviously an image, but the text doesn’t need to be. That could have been done differently, but it’s fine.</p><p>On the whole, I think it’s going great. I really like this part: “Six simple ingredients. One delicious bowl of guac.” That tells me right away if I’m interested. Also, notice how the text is short; instead of putting the bulleted list all the way to the edges, they tightened the column. That makes the text easier to read quickly, and I think it works super well. I thought that was a great job. And what a great footer — “Hang Now,” “Order Online,” “Rewards,” “Find a Chipotle,” “Social.” Just a nice, simple footer without too much legal text. I’m into it.</p><p><strong><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/479b3f6def984c8aab809e58710de4fc"">Matt Helbig:</strong> The numbered list is what really stood out to me. We rarely see that in an email. I guess a recipe is one of the main use cases for it. It’s a really cool idea to include it directly in the email instead of linking out to a landing page. It’s easy to follow if you want to make some guac yourself.</p><p><strong>Matthew Smith:</strong> Yep. It also looks really good on mobile.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig:</strong>&nbsp;I’m impressed with that. I like that these GIFs aren’t full video; they’re more like a few image steps, which works much better in email since it keeps file sizes smaller. This one is probably five, six, seven frames, and you still get the full effect — you know it’s guacamole. Instead of a full video that’s ten megabytes or more, these lightweight GIFs are smarter. Even at the top, they stepped the email into multiple images, so you probably don’t lose much in the first frame, even in Outlook.</p><p><strong>Matthew Smith: </strong>Good job, Chipotle. Looking forward to the next one.</p>",mtthlbg,mtthlbg,,,"Mon, 08 Dec 2025 23:00:00 GMT"

So, do you want to introduce a little bit about this brand?<img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/79744f50f6ee40beac087072a46dacd4"">(<a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/imbodhi-success"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">See the full email</a>)</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck</strong>: This is In <a href=""https://imbodhi.co/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Imbodhi</a>. We've been working with them since 2022, which is approximately three and a half years, or close to four years. They are a lifestyle brand selling very unique clothing. They're sustainable, with a very authentic brand tone and voice, and very earthy visual tones. They started with a hero product when we first began working with them, but since then, they've introduced numerous new products. Now they're known for many different things. What we see here in the image, I believe, was the hero product that they initially grew with.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Cool. Awesome. This appears to be the first welcome email I would receive after signing up on the website. It's quite clear from the welcome messaging. I like the “make yourself at home”; that's a nice little touch. Having a promo code here for 15% off is great. Scrolling down the email, we come to the body copy, which discusses the product. Then we have a section with testimonials. It's nice to see some five-star reviews, accompanied by a little rotating GIF. “Try it for yourself” is a pretty focused CTA. So what captures your attention at the top? When putting this together, is there anything that really stands out to you that you particularly like?</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck</strong>: I think that above-the-scroll part—the first thing we see when we open the email—does a good job of transmitting the tone and ethos of the brand. Very earthy tones, we see the hero product, and it all looks very smooth, kind, and welcoming, which is what this brand is about. I love that the CTA is so high up. We try to do that because it's great for click-through rate, though we don't always get to. This time it is really high up, which is great. It definitely helps with conversion rates as well. Something we try to be conscious about is repeating the offer and making it very clear multiple times. I guess we’re only doing that once with the button here, but I feel like it's enough. It makes it clear that they get 15% off with the button, and the code is right there and copy-pastable. Those are the good things that stand out to me.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Yeah, I like it. I like this little wavy transition. Over the last couple of years, we've seen this emerge frequently—almost too much—but I think it works well here in conjunction with the rest of the product. On mobile, you actually see a different wave, which is a cool effect. With this product suite and brand, it makes sense to introduce something more organic or nature-based that ties into the rest of the products.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck</strong>: I like this one over here. What stands out is that it really jumps out at me: I would add another CTA under the paragraph text right here. It feels like it's missing. Yeah, for people who actually do read and will read all of this paragraph copy—which, you know, a lot of haters are going to say is too much copy—but we can talk about it. This brand actually sees better results with more lengthy, poetic copy. However, the button could benefit from another button.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: I agree. I could see a lot of people taking action up here, but like you said, maybe another CTA. I would love this to be plain text. It appears to have good alt text; on mobile, hovering over it seems to work fine. Reorganizing or re-spacing that paragraph makes it more accessible. It doesn't shrink down, so the text remains readable on mobile devices. As a piece of copy, it's a nice bite-sized piece. What is the value, for you, of adding something like this in a welcome email—like having testimonials?</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck</strong>:&nbsp;This is where the shopper's intent is at its highest. They subscribe through the pop-up, they want that discount, and they're probably seriously considering buying from this brand. We just need to get them over that finish line. Testimonials and reviews from other customers definitely help. Welcome Email 1 is one area where we conduct A/B testing on a regular basis. We have a very robust experimentation culture in general at Luck and Co. We like to A/B test concepts more than subject lines or colors. I'm sure this is something that has been tested and helped drive conversions.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Scrolling down, we encounter a small lockup that connects some of the text to these icons, highlighting the benefits of the product. Sustainable packaging, fabric sourcing—things important to people and possibly reasons they’re paying a premium.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck</strong>: The “code expires in seven days” would probably be placed right under the code or the button. I don't know why we hide it so much. It's something I enjoy doing. Perhaps the design doesn't look as nice.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: I think it works for legal. Maybe even less of an asterisk, and work the expiration into the copy so it doesn't feel too legal-heavy. Something like “Use your code within seven days,” or “Check out within the week.” Or even: “Use code (expires in 7 days).” I don't see that welcome offer expiring, but it's good to know. Maybe it's an urgency thing.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck</strong>:&nbsp;We always make it expire. We like it; it's a thing for us. Even seven days is kind of generous. We can definitely see that with an expiration date, people use it much more quickly and often. I have a question for you about making this text plain. We'll likely discuss accessibility in depth today. I can see a case for making that paragraph live text, because it's just text on a plain background—easy to replicate. However, with other designs, it's more challenging. However, if we do that here, the font will look very different from the rest of the email. That visual inconsistency is something our clients and we don't like. How do you see that trade-off?</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Some email clients support web fonts, which can allow for the use of specific brand fonts. There are web-safe fallbacks. Many websites already have a fallback font. To me, it's not an all-or-nothing thing. Not every part of the email needs to be live text. You can look for opportunities where live text genuinely helps. For example, if a Spanish-speaking person is reading this email, they can't translate it because the text is baked into an image. Accessibility in that sense can also be helpful. In this tool, we don't display the no-image mode; however, if images are disabled, you will only see the code. Everything else would be blank, which isn’t ideal. A CTA or some core messaging in live text would still be visible. So yes, brand consistency is important, but accessibility also matters. Some people may notice a slightly different font, but I’m not sure if that would deter them from making a purchase.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck</strong>: Yeah, I think it really matters. Obviously, it's best if everything is accessible; however, there's a trade-off, and we make decisions based on those trade-offs. That decision, I think, should be specific to each brand. For example, you mentioned a Spanish-speaking person might be reading this. I immediately thought, well, they don’t sell in Spain. I actually don't know where they sell—maybe they sell worldwide. However, even if they didn't, there are many Spanish-speaking people in the US as well. So that reasoning doesn’t work.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: I mean, people who may have increased the font size on their phone or screen readers. It appears that you have some effective alt text on these sections.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck</strong>:&nbsp;We do, yeah.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: So that's definitely a good benefit. I think that covers your bases in a lot of ways. But there could still be opportunities. If we were to build this in our <a href=""https://beefree.io/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Beefree builder</a>, this would be a four-by-four grid, and you could lay it out. Perhaps the fonts wouldn't look exactly the same everywhere—maybe they wouldn't display correctly in Outlook—but if I had images turned off, I would still understand what this is, not just from the alt text. Things like this: if it's a gif, sometimes we don’t love text being locked up in a gif, but for this section, it makes sense since it’s rotating through the reviews. It doesn’t have to be everywhere, but when it comes to accessibility, there are some places where it makes sense. I think you also solve a lot of issues by doing different layouts for desktop and mobile. Some brands maintain the desktop view, which becomes too small and difficult to read on mobile. By creating a separate image export for mobile, you resolve many of those issues. For example, if a CTA were too small, I couldn’t even tap it on a phone. However, you do a good job of keeping it large enough to tap comfortably on mobile devices.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck</strong>: Thank you. Yeah, we're very meticulous about having a mobile version that works.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: To me, that's a significant priority, especially in e-commerce, where many lists skew heavily toward mobile. I think focusing on mobile is also part of accessibility. Even if it's not live text, ensuring it's accessible on mobile is a significant consideration. I think you're doing a good job, and I like this email. My last piece of feedback from my notes is this: I sometimes personally prefer to see lifestyle images, but I also want to see the actual products. Perhaps having a section that showcases best sellers, or a starting point to better understand the catalog, could help bring me back to the discount code. This is clear—I'm going to go back and use it on my cart. However, if I signed up just for emails, it might be beneficial to showcase some of the most popular products as a standalone module, rather than just lifestyle images and text. That’s my personal opinion.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck</strong>: That's fair. Yeah, I can see that.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Cool. I think that’s actually a good idea to A/B test here. Sweet. Alright, let's keep moving to the next email. We have another engaging GIF at the top. Would you like to discuss this<img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/a46e54991b784feeb02bdc51891395bb"">(<a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/new-our-first-ever-dress"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">See the full image here</a>)</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck</strong>: Yes, this was a new product launch email where they introduced the dress. I want to make sure I name it correctly: the Mari Skort. Yes—the Mari Skort dress. Something important for us to highlight here is that it has pockets, because that's one of the most frequently asked questions, Imodhi. Here, we have beautiful hero images showcasing the colors the product is available in, ensuring people can take action. But when we scroll down, we emphasize the different details and the pockets because that’s what people tend to be interested in.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Very cool. When I was analyzing these emails with a bit of AI, AI really liked this section for whatever reason. There you go. This kind of breakdown provides a detailed view that's unique and not often seen in fashion emails. Usually, you just see a model, a price, and a button. But for a launch email, this approach feels almost like a tech product breakdown, highlighting the micro-details. It highlights the various aspects of the product that I might actually care about. If it’s built-in shorts, that’s cool. And this is a fun CTA instead of just “Buy Now.” I really like this section.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck</strong>: Cool. One thing that really helps our work is staying in touch with customer support teams, as you learn a lot of details that aid conversions. I would’ve never guessed that pockets are such a big factor, although thinking about it, I get it. Knowing this was a frequently asked question helped make this a high-converting email.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Cool. I had some comments on the GIF. I think this text is a bit difficult to read in some of the white-on-white sections here. It’s hard sometimes—maybe adding an extra layer of opacity. Obviously, you want to see the product, but some additional contrast would help. Identifying colors like this is smart, but it almost feels like an interactive element—something I'd want to click to switch the colors. It's a UI pattern from the web, so it doesn’t really make sense here.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck</strong>: That’s what I wanted to do, too, when I first saw it. We actually have created interactive emails in the past where you click, and they interact with you, but that only works on desktop, not on mobile. So we don’t use that often. It doesn’t work like that here. However, I personally—even though it’s a little clickbait or gray-hat—like using tricks where you want to click something because you think it does something, and then it takes you to the site. Because that’s what I want: I want to take you to the site. Some people might find it annoying, but ultimately, the more people we drive to the site, the better.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: That is the main goal of the campaign. I don’t think it detracts from the email. It’s just an interesting UI element that can be used for good or bad. Scrolling down, again, it makes sense that you reworked the mobile text for that section. It’s very readable. The bottom footer section is clean, featuring the “shop now, pay later” module. Pretty solid email. Out of the emails we reviewed for this brand, this is one of the better ones. Is there anything else you’d add or change if you had the chance to resend this?</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck</strong>: From what I heard from my team, it performed really well. What you said about the contrast makes sense. I see the team attempted to fix it with a little shadow, but it’s not enough. So maybe adjusting that. Other than that, it looks solid.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Cool. Short and sweet, and like you said, I like a campaign with a singular focus. It's clear what to do next: view the product, shop for it. That's the main part of the CTA. Very clear on next steps. Alright, the next email appears to be an annual fall sale-type email. These are pretty popular. What about this one—what do you like?</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/613dea05dbc649368fb4945512d41a43"">(<a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/new-to-sale"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">See the full email</a>)</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck</strong>: Can we see the subject line? I know the theme is “new to sale,” so these were new products added to sale. I’d be curious to see the subject line. ""New to sale"" is the subject line. New to sale. Okay, great. Because that’s what we’re missing from the header. As long as it’s in the subject line, that works. The subject line is NEW TO SALE, all caps. This was sent during a long sale period, and the team wanted to add an additional email to make it more interesting. They positioned it as “new products added to sale.” Behind-the-scenes context: this was done during the Black Friday sale. One thing that is missing for me is making it clear that this is a Black Friday sale. Although if I receive this on November 30th, I know it's Black Friday, I don't need an additional label. Oh, it says “Annual Fall Sale.” That’s what Bodhi calls their sale. Instead of calling it a Black Friday sale, they refer to it as an “annual fall sale.” So we kind of do that here, but it’s not screaming “Black Friday,” which is probably just the ethos of this brand. This is their style.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Yeah. If it were Black Friday, it might have more urgency, such as “ends at midnight on X date” or something similar. Yeah. But overall, I think I like this one. I like how this headline is nicely crafted, and I appreciate how the CTA aligns with the product for both. I think that's a nice touch, using these brand colors to tie the product in. I think that's a fun idea. Do you agree that you prefer the CTA to be all one color?</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck</strong>: No, sorry, I didn’t know. I agree with you. I was just… I mean, I think this is a great idea. I thought, 'Yeah, this looks great.' I honestly do think that this looks really great. I just feel bad about saying, “Yeah, our emails look amazing, they're the best.”</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: No, I think they are good. I think they look… I think it’s smart, and it effectively conveys that message. Maybe this 30% off could be more prominent if the discount is really important to people. It does sound like, in the context of many other emails, it might be clear that, especially if there isn’t a code they have to use, when they go shopping, it will be automatically applied or something similar. So, yeah. I think this one makes a lot of sense. It does have a countdown timer here, showing when the sale ends. On the urgency side, I wonder if it’s that important. If this is around Black Friday, I mean, 12/3 is a pretty good time window to do that.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck</strong>: Yeah. That’s one thing that we do. If showing the deadline is not actually beneficial to us, and it is more than three days, it is counterproductive to inform people of the deadline, because they will then procrastinate. Three days is probably the cutoff. So maybe that was the thinking here.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Cool. Well, I like this one. I believe that many brands have observed a trend over the years of not emphasizing Black Friday messaging as much. We’ve had discussions at various conferences about how Black Friday can sometimes tarnish a brand. In a way, I think that for a premium product like this, being a little more strategic about how you discuss a sale, rather than relying heavily on discount language, makes sense. I’m sure Gymshark will have a big campaign, or some of these athletic brands will offer heavy discounts, such as “save 70% on last season’s product” or something similar. I think this is a good positioning strategy to avoid direct competition with that.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck</strong>: Yeah. I agree. And this is what Imbodhi is going for, definitely.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Cool. Alright, we’ve got an abandoned cart here. I really like this one. The subject line for this one was “I caved, and I’m not sorry,” which I really like. I think that's a really smart subject line. So what do you like about this one?</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/918fd8f694714c68911214e06d20f746"">(<a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/i-caved-and-im-not-sorry"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">See the full email</a>)</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck</strong>: That was probably taken from a review. That is where we often draw inspiration for our email content. I love most things here. Something that I am really big on for abandoned checkout emails is always including the person's first name, because we have it. People have to fill out their first name when they start a checkout and then abandon it. Personalizing with the first name generally helps with everything: how the email is perceived and where it is placed in the inbox. So I'm usually very strict when I don't see a first name in an abandoned checkout email. And we don't have it here, unless you took it off, which I don't think you did.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: I didn't for this one, no.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck</strong>: Okay. So that's one thing that stands out to me. However, I know that this is the second email in the sequence, in the abandoned checkout sequence. It’s not the first email, so maybe we can personalize it with the first name elsewhere.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: If you were to personalize it, where would it reside? Would it live in this copy or in the…?</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck</strong>: Here. I would put it there. Yeah, I’d be like, “Hey Casey, your pieces are still waiting for you to take from home to…” Some of the behind-the-scenes details are that this checkout product, the abandoned product block, has numerous customizations. If there is one product, it is centered in that way. If there are two products, they are side by side. If there are more than two products, we only show two products. We also hide things like shipping protection and other add-ons. We have additional code that hides those, so we don’t highlight them with the huge, ugly placeholder item that Shopify has for that. So those are some of the behind-the-scenes details. For abandoned checkout emails, we try to keep them focused. This is what you need to do. We also want to have a reason for emailing a person every time we do. Therefore, we avoid sending an abandoned checkout email that only contains the abandoned product block, without any additional content. As a shopper, why should I buy this? I was already considering it. Yes, perhaps some people simply forget and need a reminder, but we believe that, in addition to reminding them, we also want to provide them with another reason to shop. In this particular email, we chose to remind them that they have payment options, because these products are on the higher end in terms of price. Then we have a social proof block in the form of UGC from Instagram, so these are products worn by customers.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: That's cool. Yeah, I think it’s cool to connect something you see in your cart with a person wearing it. I think that's a smart play. And I do really like the live text here. I think that’s a good piece. This low stock messaging is also a big motivator for me, as I’ve seen many other people use it. They’ll even have launch emails that say, “Last time we launched this, it went out of stock in 24 hours, make sure to pick it up while you can.” So that’s nice to see. Another scenario that could occur is if something they had previously abandoned went out of stock. If it’s back in stock and they still haven’t checked out, that might be another message people could try, especially if they’ve never seen it before. It’s kind of a small idea. Alright, well, guess what? We actually did buy this. Wow. We were convinced. I needed a jumpsuit. It was missing in my life, so I’m glad I did that. What do you like about this one?</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/c619950046e947048cfbbe86ecf4aaf7"">(<a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/great-news-your-imbdhi-order-is-confirmed"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">See the full email</a>)</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck</strong>: This is the order confirmation email. We moved that from Shopify into Klaviyo, so we’re sending this from Klaviyo. It’s a transactional email, so there’s a limit on what we can do here. It seems straightforward and clear, providing me with the necessary information for my order. There’s a clear CTA to track my order if I want to. Ultimately, we reinforce the brand values, not necessarily the brand story itself, but rather the brand values, continuing the journey of educating the customer about this brand. We’re building the foundation for them to come back and purchase from us again, because they love not only the product, which feels amazing, comfortable, and really great, but also because they identify with the brand's values. That is the thinking behind this block.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: That's smart. Yeah. I think a receipt is always a great opportunity to do more than just show the required information. It’s nice to see something like this. It may encourage people to lean more towards advocacy once they receive the product. There are also nice features here, such as an FAQ page that addresses any issues with my order. All those things build a bit of trust and make people feel good about their purchase.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck</strong>: You have a great attention to detail.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Hey, it’s my job. Alright, the last email we have here is an SMS push that you let me know is part of a post-purchase flow, actually.</p><p><img src=""https://files.reallygoodemails.com/blogContentImages/103a0fe3b8fb4ca8b40c7eb143006149"">(<a href=""https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/enjoy-15-off"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">See the full email</a>)</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck</strong>: Yep. This is also from a post-purchase flow. It's the post-purchase flow triggered by the “delivered” metric, so after the product has been delivered. I think this is email three in that particular sequence. There are product education and care instructions that come before this. At this point, the flow is split based on whether a person is an SMS subscriber or not. If they're not an SMS subscriber, then they receive this email. If they are an SMS subscriber, they receive something else. For Imbodhi, and for many of the brands we work with, we position SMS as this VIP channel that gets first dibs on everything. Sometimes they receive extra promotions, extra savings, and other benefits. Therefore, it makes sense for us to try to acquire as many customers as possible through the SMS channel. If somebody has bought a product and they're not on SMS, that's unusual. They should be, and that’s our thinking behind this. Especially for Imbodhi, because it's not fast fashion. It's not T-shirts. Many of their customers make a single purchase, and then they must work hard to encourage them to make a second purchase. Having a phone number enables us to engage in SMS marketing, which is particularly helpful in achieving that goal. So that's the strategy behind this.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Cool. Yeah, I like this one. Even just a little preview here, letting them know what they can expect when they subscribe, is nice to see. And this section, I think, is pretty smart—maybe pulling in some things based on their purchases or bestseller data.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck</strong>: This is a dynamic product block. Yeah. I looked it up. It's recommended products based on both purchase history and browsing history, excluding products that are out of stock, and one other condition. So it is personalized.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Nice. Short and sweet. People are always looking for inspiration for these SMS things, and with some segmentation, it becomes a more targeted email that can get them to subscribe if you really want them on that list. So, yeah. Yeah. Sweet. Alright, well, thanks for taking the time to look at this brand. Do you have any other thoughts or comments on this one?</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck</strong>: Go check out Imbodhi. They are a truly exceptional brand. There’s a very thoughtful team behind it. We're a smaller, boutique agency that doesn’t work with a large number of brands, and we love working with brands that bring something unique to the world beyond just their product. That team is definitely doing that. It’s been a pleasure working with them. It’s been fun reviewing these emails. I think some of these were created a long time ago, and they still look good. There’s always an opportunity to optimize something, so some of the things you mentioned were very helpful, and I’m going to pass them on to the team.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: We’ll definitely keep an eye on these emails, subscribe to the list, and add some more to Really Good Emails. Where can people find you? Your YouTube channel is the best place for people to find you.</p><p><strong>Kasey Luck</strong>: Yep. If you go to YouTube and search for Casey Luck, it should be easy to find. And don't forget to check out our agency’s website too: it’s Luckandco. agency. We do email and SMS for e-commerce brands.</p><p><strong>Matt Helbig</strong>: Awesome. Great. Thanks again.</p>",mtthlbg,mtthlbg,,,"Thu, 04 Dec 2025 23:00:00 GMT"
