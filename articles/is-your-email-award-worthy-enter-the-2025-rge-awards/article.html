They connected, resonated, and inspired.</p><hr><p><strong>How to Submit Your Email</strong></p><p>Think your latest campaign deserves some love? Maybe you're chasing glory. Perhaps you just want to outshine Greg from Sales, who won't stop talking about his "industry-leading open rates." Either way, this is your moment.</p><p><strong>How it works:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Choose your champion</strong> – Submit your best email from 2025.
