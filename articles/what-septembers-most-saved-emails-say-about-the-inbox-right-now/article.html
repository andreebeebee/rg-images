<p>You can tell last month’s inbox got a therapist.</p><p>After <a href="https://reallygoodemails.com/school/july-email-trends-cinematic" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">summer’s email designs</a> with loud colors and look-at-me styling, brands collecting <a href="https://reallygoodemails.com/u/TeamRGE/collections/dGWkzHub7Z6DT1cGo7j8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">September emails</a> collectively decided to take a deep breath, light a eucalyptus candle, and write in their journal: <em>“We’re chill now.”</em></p><p>The vibe? <strong>Polished. Playful. Practical. </strong>Or, if you prefer your adjectives less pretentious and lacking alliteration: <em>clean, funny, and trying its best not to have a mental breakdown before Q4.</em></p><p>September was full of brands trying to <em>help</em> you, not <em>sell</em> to you. <a href="https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/introducing-home-planet-fund" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Patagonia</a> wants to heal the planet, <a href="https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/just-launched-plastic-detox-kit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bite</a> wants to heal your mouth, and <a href="https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/new-co-op-cycles-bikes-new-clothing-brand" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">REI</a> redesigned something that was already fine — but now it’s sustainable, which made other email makers happy enough to save it.</p><p><img src="image-2.webp"></p><p>Even the <a href="https://reallygoodemails.com/categories/labor-day" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Labor Day emails</a> were like, “Hey, no pressure, but if you want to spend money, that’d be emotionally mature of you.”</p><p>On the photo front, not a single AI-generated hand in sight. Just honest-to-God human hands <a href="https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/our-august-coffee-menu-just-dropped" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pouring</a>, <a href="https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/this-heatwave-just-met-its-match" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pouring</a>, and more <a href="https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/welcome-to-our-flock" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pouring</a>. The product shots were less studio-staged as we’ve seen in prior months, bringing back that more casual feel that you may encounter in real life.<em> </em>And there were noticeably fewer models this time around that took center stage (though, Jimmy Fallon did catch our eye).</p><p><img src="image-3.webp"></p><p>Happily, compared to <a href="https://reallygoodemails.com/u/TeamRGE/collections/JmD6jnx5srxkQBIa2pjY" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2024’s September most-saved emails</a>, the month prior to Halloween finally figured out how to acknowledge fall without dressing up like a pumpkin-spiced latte. Back-to-school? Sure, but it’s about <em>personal growth. </em>Seasonal stress? Sip on something and take some vitamins. Upcoming day off work? Ditch the corny pumpkin patch visits for self-care.</p><p>That may have also been helped by the dominant colors this month, looking like they were pulled from a boutique hotel in Copenhagen: muted sage, creamy beige, soft lavender, mossy greens, and a dash of yellow for serotonin. A nice transition to fall with a bit of shyness away from being too bold.</p><p>Even the discounts are shy now. “<a href="https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/new-season-new-routine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Start your ritual.</a>” “<a href="https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/welcome-to-our-flock" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Join the flock.</a>” “<a href="https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/slow-sip-sunday-volume-02" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Calm is calling.</a>”</p><p>It’s all very <em>‘gentle cult recruitment but make it brand-safe.’ </em>And that’s because trust is the new urgency. The best-performing emails assume you’re already in love and just need a little nudge.</p><p>As for new trends, the biggest one we’re seeing right now is the blur. Not as in <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3GfOAdcoc3X5GPiiXmpBjK" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Song #2</a> (which is still one of my favorites and acutely played into our presentation at SaaSiest Amsterdam a couple of weeks ago), but rather as motion blurs. <a href="https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/introducing-the-science-of-sleeping" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Brez</a>, <a href="https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/psst-you-got-first-dibs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MeUndies</a>, <a href="https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/ten-events-one-new-pace-breaker-kit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lululemon</a>, <a href="https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/rainforest-wild-foods-waitlist-is-open" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Buoy</a>, and <a href="https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/its-official-churro-latte-is-back" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Verb</a> are all blurring the hell out of their visuals. This isn’t bad Photoshop; it’s intentional.</p><p><img src="image-4.webp"></p><p>Blurs are doing three very specific things right now: Creating softness in the scroll.<strong> </strong>When your inbox is an endless grid of sharp rectangles screaming “SALE,” a little Gaussian glow feels like a nap for your retinas. Brez’s haziness and Verb’s <a href="https://reallygoodemails.com/categories/back-in-stock" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">back-in-stock email</a> opaqueness look calm. MeUndies uses it to cause you to focus. LuluLemon captures it in motion to draw your eye to what’s happening.</p><p>So if you felt like your inbox got oddly serene last month, it’s because it did. Brands collectively decided to dim the lights, lower their cortisol, and speak in lowercase.</p><p>Blurs, beiges, and a sprinkle of emotional stability… that’s the September formula. If this is what Q4 looks like, we might just make it through without rage-deleting our promotions tab.</p>
