<p>What happens when two marketing teams go head-to-head in a game show powered by real survey data? Chaos, laughter, and a few surprisingly honest truths about how marketers really think.</p><p>We recently teamed up for Marketing Mayhem, a buzzer-smashing, survey-powered game show hosted by Shakuri and fueled by insights from 100+ marketers. Team RGE (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/logansandrock/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Logan Sandrock Baird</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelevan/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mike Nelson</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelsey-yen/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kelsey Yen</a>) faced off against Team <a href="http://customer.io" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Customer.io</a> (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/naomiwest1000/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Naomi West</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/codystover/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cody Stover</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennamariecarter/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jenna Carter</a>) across six rounds, one Critical Take Arena, and a final showdown.</p><p>The rules were simple: the host asked questions based on survey responses, and each team had to guess the top answers. Between all the jokes and buzzer chaos, real patterns began to emerge — about AI, KPIs, welcome emails, and the beliefs that marketers still hold.</p><p>Here’s what we learned from the mayhem 👇</p><h2>Round 1 — The buzzwords that make marketers’ eyes twitch</h2><p>The first question set the tone for the chaos: “What buzzword makes your eye twitch every time it hits your inbox?”</p><p>From <em>growth hacking</em> to <em>generative AI</em>, both teams wasted no time calling out the words that make marketers collectively cringe. Team RGE guessed <strong>“omnichannel,”</strong> which made the board, while <strong>“synergy”</strong> and <strong>“data-driven”</strong> earned a few knowing laughs but didn’t make the cut. When Team Customer.io got their turn, they threw in <strong>“streamlined”</strong> — sparking a debate about whether <em>“streamlined”</em> and <em>“seamless”</em> are basically the same thing (they are).</p><p><strong>Top answers revealed:</strong></p><ul><li>Growth hacking <em>(#1)</em></li><li>Generative AI</li><li>Customer-centric</li><li>Authentic engagement</li><li>Omnichannel / Seamless</li></ul><p><strong>What it means:</strong></p><p>The round made one thing clear: marketers are tired of buzzwords that sound smart but don’t convey much meaning. <em>“Growth hacking”</em> and <em>“authentic engagement”</em> might look good in a subject line, but they’ve lost meaning through overuse. As several players joked, if your message is truly <em>customer-centric</em>, your audience shouldn’t need to be told — they should feel it in the experience.</p><p>🧠 <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Drop the jargon. Instead of saying <em>“seamless omnichannel experience,”</em> try <em>“We’ll text you when your order ships.”</em></p><h2>Round 2 — The real MVP of a welcome email</h2><p>The next question hit closer to home for every email marketer: “What’s the real MVP of a welcome email?”</p><p>Team Customer.io buzzed in first with <strong>“personalization,”</strong> followed closely by <strong>Team RGE</strong>, who went for <strong>“subject line.” </strong>Both made the board — and from there, the debate took off.</p><p>Throughout the round, teams threw out everything from <strong>CTA</strong> and <strong>send timing</strong> to <strong>offers</strong> and <strong>good copy</strong>. Some guesses, like <em>“good copy”</em> or <em>“the sender,”</em> surprisingly <em>didn’t</em> make the list — sparking collective disbelief (and some very relatable marketer frustration).</p><p>When the dust settled, the <strong>top answers revealed</strong> were:</p><ul><li><strong>Clear next steps / clear value</strong> <em>(Logan’s winning steal)</em></li><li><strong>Subject line</strong></li><li><strong>CTA</strong></li><li><strong>Send timing</strong></li><li><strong>Mobile optimization/design layout</strong></li></ul><p>Team RGE took the round after naming “clear next steps,” clinching it with what might be the most marketer-approved answer of all.</p><p><strong>What it means:</strong></p><p>The welcome email isn’t just a formality — it sets the tone for your entire relationship.</p><p>What matters most isn’t clever copy or even a great offer; it’s <em>clarity</em>. Readers need to know <strong>what to do next</strong>, when to do it, and why it matters — all in one scroll.</p><p><strong>🧠 Pro tip:</strong></p><p>A perfect welcome email says: <em>“We’re glad you’re here — here’s exactly what to do next.” </em>Keep it simple, mobile-friendly, and timely.</p><h2>Round 3 — The KPIs marketers are too obsessed with</h2><p>By round three, things started getting real. “Name a KPI marketers are way too obsessed with.”</p><p>Team Customer.io buzzed in first with <strong>MQLs</strong>, but surprisingly, it <em>didn’t</em> make the board. Team RGE followed up with the obvious choice: <strong>open rate</strong> — and they were right on target.</p><p>From there, the guesses came fast: <strong>click-through rate, list size, unsubscribes, impressions,</strong> and <strong>social reach. </strong>Each sparked laughs and groans in equal measure, as both teams realized just how many metrics marketers track without really learning from them.</p><p>When the board was revealed, the <strong>top answers</strong> were:</p><ul><li><strong>Email list size</strong> <em>(#1)</em></li><li><strong>Click-through rate (CTR)</strong></li><li><strong>Unsubscribes</strong></li><li><strong>Impressions</strong></li><li><strong>Bounce rate</strong></li></ul><p>The conversation that followed hit a nerve. Naomi and Logan agreed that <strong>list size</strong> is the ultimate <em>vanity metric</em>: it looks impressive, but means nothing without engagement. They also pointed out that metrics like <strong>CTR</strong> and <strong>bounce rate</strong> are still valuable when used in context, while <strong>impressions</strong> feel too vague to drive real improvement.</p><p><strong>What it means:</strong></p><p>Marketers love numbers — but not all numbers tell the truth. This round reminded everyone that the metrics we obsess over often say more about ego than performance. A large list or a high open rate doesn’t guarantee success if your audience isn’t reading, clicking, or engaging.</p><p><strong>🧠 Pro tip:</strong></p><p>Track <strong>quality over quantity</strong>. Measure what drives real connection — retention, conversions, and engagement — not just what fills a dashboard.</p><h2><strong>Round 4 — What marketers pretend to understand</strong></h2><p>By round four, things took a philosophical turn. “What’s one thing most marketers are faking their understanding of?”</p><p>Team RGE buzzed in first with the answer everyone expected: <strong>AI</strong> — and it took the #1 spot immediately. From there, the board filled with equally tricky concepts: <strong>attribution modeling, analytics tools, data privacy, GDPR,</strong> and <strong>lifecycle marketing. </strong>Logan called out <strong>AI</strong> as “something we all nod along to, then Google later.” Mike added that many marketers still don’t truly understand <strong>multi-touch attribution</strong>, while Kelsey pointed to <strong>deliverability</strong> as a recurring mystery. Later in the round, Jenna from Team Customer.io nailed a big one — <strong>customer lifecycle journey mapping</strong> — after a few hints from the host.</p><p><strong>Top answers revealed:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>AI</strong> <em>(#1)</em></li><li><strong>Attribution / Multi-touch modeling</strong></li><li><strong>Data privacy &amp; GDPR</strong></li><li><strong>Analytics tools (GA4, Amplitude, etc.)</strong></li><li><strong>Customer lifecycle mapping</strong></li><li><strong>Omnichannel marketing</strong></li><li><strong>Customer lifetime value</strong></li><li><strong>Marketing mix modeling</strong></li></ul><p>The discussion that followed was one of the best in the show. Cody admitted that many marketers fall back on “Let the AI do it” — even when they’re not sure what that means.&nbsp;Logan explained that AI isn’t truly “intelligent” — it’s predictive, and humans are predictable — while Mike warned that giving AI too much control can lead to <strong>dark patterns</strong> and <strong>clickbait tactics</strong>. Kelsey highlighted how she uses AI to <strong>spot patterns and friction points</strong>, but still relies on human empathy to shape the message. And Jenna reminded everyone that with data protection laws tightening, <strong>human-written copy</strong> and <strong>authentic tone</strong> will always outperform machine output.</p><p><strong>What it means:</strong></p><p>AI might be changing the game, but this round proved that human judgment still wins. Technology can surface data, patterns, and insights — but empathy, ethics, and creative intuition can’t be automated.</p><p><strong>🧠 Pro tip:</strong></p><p>Let AI handle the <em>how</em>. Keep humans in charge of the <em>why</em>.</p><h2><strong>Critical take arena (CTA): AI, Emotion, and the Human Touch</strong></h2><p>This was the round where things took a philosophical turn. Logan (RGE) and Naomi (Customer.io) joined forces for a lightning-fast discussion about the future of marketing — and where humans still matter most.</p><p><strong>What we learned:</strong></p><ul><li>People cancel subscriptions when emails feel repetitive, irrelevant, or expensive.</li><li>Marketers use AI most often for brainstorming, copywriting, and send-time optimization.</li><li>However, no matter how advanced the tools become, AI still can’t replicate empathy, tone, or instinct.</li></ul><p>🧠 <strong>Pro tip:</strong></p><p>Use AI for the <em>how</em>, but keep control of the <em>why. </em>And while automation tools like <a href="https://beefree.io/?utm_source=reallygoodemails&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;utm_content=article" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Beefree</a> can streamline workflows, the creative direction — the empathy and intent behind every message — still remains yours.</p><h2><strong>Round 5 — Your campaign just flopped. What’s your first panic move?</strong></h2><p>After the deep talk about AI, it was time for a reality check. “Your campaign just flopped. What’s your first panic move?”</p><p>Team Customer.io jumped in with <strong>“A/B test!”</strong> — a solid answer that made the board. Team RGE countered with <strong>“Cry”</strong> — which, somehow, was also on the list (and arguably the most relatable). As guesses rolled in, things got funnier and more real: <strong>Check the links, optimize the offer, resend it, and even reevaluate the data. </strong>When Logan finally guessed <strong>“Check deliverability,”</strong> Team RGE stole the round — and took home a mountain of points.</p><p><strong>Top answers revealed:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Check deliverability</strong> <em>(#1)</em></li><li><strong>Segment differently</strong></li><li><strong>Pretend it was a test</strong></li><li><strong>Change the subject line and resend</strong></li><li><strong>Blame the data</strong></li><li><strong>Cry (relatable)</strong></li></ul><p>In the post-round discussion, both teams agreed that a failed send isn’t the end — it’s a moment to troubleshoot, learn, and adapt. Naomi joked about the panic that sets in before realizing it’s often just a deliverability issue. Mike added that pretending a bad send was “just a test” might be the oldest trick in the book.</p><p><strong>What it means:</strong></p><p>Every marketer has been there — a campaign bombs, and panic hits. But the best teams don’t spiral; they investigate. Checking deliverability, list quality, and audience segmentation can reveal the real reason performance tanked — long before you need to cry.</p><p><strong>🧠 Pro tip:</strong></p><p>Before you blame your creative, <strong>check if your audience has ever seen it.</strong></p><p>Deliverability comes first, recovery second.</p><h2><strong>Final Hill — What email marketers still believe in</strong></h2><p>After five rounds of mayhem, one last question brought everyone together: “What’s a hill lifecycle marketers will absolutely die on?”</p><p>By this point, there was no buzzer chaos — just nods, laughs, and strong opinions. Naomi went first, choosing the classic belief: <strong>“Personalization matters.” </strong>From there, the board revealed what most marketers still hold dear, even in the age of automation and AI.</p><p><strong>Top beliefs revealed:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Email isn’t dead</strong> <em>(#1)</em></li><li><strong>Quality &gt; Quantity</strong></li><li><strong>Timing &gt; Perfect copy</strong></li><li><strong>Automation isn’t “set it and forget it”</strong></li><li><strong>Every touchpoint should add value</strong></li><li><strong>First-party data is king</strong></li><li><strong>Batch and blast is dead</strong></li><li><strong>Context over content</strong></li><li><strong>Frequency caps are non-negotiable</strong></li><li><strong>Personalization matters</strong></li></ul><p>As the host scrolled through the final board, everyone agreed: despite the new tools, trends, and AI hype, <strong>email marketing remains a human craft. </strong>Timing, tone, and trust — not just templates or automations — are what build real connection.</p><p><strong>What it means:</strong></p><p>Marketers may argue about KPIs or buzzwords, but they’re united by one truth: <em>email still works because people do. </em>Every click, open, or reply is built on empathy, relevance, and respect for the audience.</p><p><strong>🧠 Pro tip:</strong></p><p>Build your lifecycle journeys like relationships:</p><ul><li>Be consistent.</li><li>Be considerate.</li><li>Never ghost your subscribers.</li></ul><h2><strong>The final score</strong></h2><p>🏆 <strong>Team RGE:</strong> 533 points</p><p>💪 <strong>Team Customer.io:</strong> 247 points</p><p>There were no losers — just marketers with slightly different buzzword trauma (and a few new inside jokes to take back to their teams).</p><h2><strong>Final thoughts</strong></h2><p>In the end, <em>Marketing Mayhem</em> wasn’t just a game show — it was a snapshot of how marketers really think, react, and learn. Between the laughter and lighthearted chaos, it revealed something deeper: marketers crave <strong>clarity, creativity, and connection</strong> more than ever. As Shakuri signed off, the message was clear: The inbox may be chaotic, but that’s where the magic happens. Until next time: <strong>Keep testing. Keep learning. And please… check your deliverability before you cry.</strong></p><h2><strong>&nbsp;TL;DR — What we learned from the Mayhem</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Email isn’t dead.</strong> The tools evolve, but human connection remains the driving force behind performance.</li><li><strong>Clarity beats complexity.</strong> Whether it’s a buzzword-free subject line or a clear CTA, simplicity wins.</li><li><strong>Vanity metrics fool us.</strong> Big lists and open rates mean nothing without engagement.</li><li><strong>AI is powerful — but not emotional.</strong> Let it speed up your process, not replace your judgment.</li><li><strong>When campaigns flop, don’t panic.</strong> Check deliverability, learn fast, and move on.</li></ul>
